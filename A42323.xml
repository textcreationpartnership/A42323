         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>HOW difficult a thing it is to produce form out of things, <hi>shapeless</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,</hi>
and to prescribe limits to things <hi>confused,</hi> there is none but may
easily perceive, if he shall take but a sleight view of the <hi>Chaos-like</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperation
of things not only diverse but repugnant in Nature, hitherto
concorporated in the generous Profession of <hi>Heraldry:</hi> as the forms of the pure <hi>Caele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
Bodies,</hi> mix'd with gross <hi>Terrestrials; Earthly Animals,</hi> with <hi>Watery; Savage Beasts,</hi>
with <hi>Tame; Whole-footed Beasts,</hi> with <hi>Divided; Reptiles,</hi> with things <hi>Gressible; Fowls of
Prey,</hi> with <hi>Home-bred;</hi> these again, with <hi>River-Fowls; Airy Insecta,</hi> with <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
also things <hi>Natural,</hi> with <hi>Artificial; Arts Liberal,</hi> with <hi>Mechanical;
Military,</hi> with <hi>Rustical;</hi> and <hi>Rustick</hi> with <hi>Civil.</hi> Which confused <hi>mixture</hi> hath not a
little discouraged many persons (otherwise well affected to the study of <hi>Armory</hi>) and
impaired the estimation of the Profession. For redress whereof my self (though
unablest of many) have done my best, in this my <hi>Display of Heraldry,</hi> to dissolve this
deformed <hi>Lump,</hi> distributing, and digesting each particular thereof into his peculiar
<hi>Rank;</hi> wherein, albeit the issue of my Enterprise be not answerable to the height of
my desires, yet do I assure my self my labour herein will not be altogether fruitless;
forasmuch as hereby I have broken the <hi>Ice,</hi> and made way to some after-comers of
greater Gifts and riper Judgment, that they may give a fairer body to this my delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
rough draught, or shadow of a new-fram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d method. For if men of greatest skill
have failed to give absolute form to their works, notwithstanding their best endeavours,
with little reason may such perfection be expected from me, whose <hi>Talent</hi> is so small, as
that I am forced to build wholly upon other mens Foundations; and therefore may be
thought to have undertaken an idle task, in writing of things formerly handled and
published by persons of more sufficiency and greater judgment. Notwithstanding,
<pb facs="tcp:55096:5"/>
who knoweth not, that as every man hath his proper conceit and invention, so hath he
his several drift and purpose, so as divers men writing of one self <hi>Argument,</hi> do han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
the same diversty? which being so, what letteth that every of us, writing in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
kind, may not without offence to other, use our uttermost endeavours to give unto
this erst unshapely and disproportionable profession of <hi>Heraldry,</hi> a true <hi>Symmetria</hi> and
proportionable correspondence of each part to other? Inasmuch (if I be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
both they and my self do all aim at one mark, which is, so to adorn and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
this Science, as that it being purged from her wonted deformities, may become more
plausible to many, and be favourably entertained of all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which could not be otherwise
better effected, than by dissolving of this <hi>Chaos-like</hi> or confused Lump, and dissever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of each particular thereof from other, and disposing them under their peculiar
Heads, which is the full scope of these my <hi>Travels.</hi> Now to the end I might the bet-accomplish
this <hi>Task,</hi> after I had carefully collected the chief <hi>Grounds, Principles, Rules,</hi>
and <hi>Observations</hi> that <hi>Ger. Leigh, Boswell, Ferne, Bara, Chassaneus,</hi> and other best appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Authors</hi> in their several <hi>Works</hi> have written touching the <hi>Rudiments</hi> and first <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
of <hi>Armory;</hi> then did I seriously bethink my self for the orderly distribution of those
their dispersed <hi>Notes</hi> and <hi>Observations</hi> so by me collected, and digesting of them into
some form of <hi>Method,</hi> or at the least into some <hi>Methodical resemblance,</hi> wherein I hope
I have in some sort accomplished my desire, and have for thy better understanding
and apprehension (<hi>gentle Reader</hi>) first distributed this work into <hi>Sections,</hi> and those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Chapters,</hi> briefly shewing their several substances and orderly connexions; and
throughout the whole I have begun with the <hi>Genus</hi> of each kind, and severed them into
their <hi>Species,</hi> which also are subdivided into <hi>Individua's,</hi> annexing particular <hi>Rules</hi> to
each several sort. Moreover, I have added <hi>Definitions, Divisions,</hi> and <hi>Etymologies</hi> of
the Artificial terms peculiarly pertaining to this <hi>Art,</hi> bestowed the chief <hi>Grounds,
Principles, Rules</hi> and <hi>Observations</hi> under their proper Heads, and manifested their use

sense and vigor, in default whereof they would become destitute of all force, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that saying of <hi>Aretius, Praecepta, quantumvis bona &amp; concinna, mortua sunt, nisi ipse

<hi>Analogical Table,</hi> briefly comprehending the substance of each subsequent <hi>Section,</hi> and
that with such coherence that each of the said <hi>Tables</hi> answereth in a Relative respect of
the one of them to the other; so as all of them do <hi>jump</hi> together in an universal cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
as by their particular references doth manifestly appear, whereby I have brought
to pass (though with long and difficult labour) that in this my <hi>Display of Heraldry,</hi> thou
mayest easily find (bestowed according to <hi>Order</hi>) whatsoever thou desirest concerning
the <hi>Principles</hi> of this <hi>Profession:</hi> So that thou in short time, and with much ease, mayest
reap not only a profitable <hi>Gleaning,</hi> but a plentiful <hi>Harvest</hi> of this my long and painful

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hosoever shall address himself
to write of matters of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
or of any other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of importance, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth,
that before he enter
thereinto, he should reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
determine with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in what order he will
handle the same: So shall he best accomplish that
he hath undertaken, and inform the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and help the memory of the Reader. For so
doth <hi>Chassaneus</hi> admonish us; saying, <hi>Priusquam
ad scientiam perveniatur, bonum est, modum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribere
docendi, &amp; ordinem; quia per ordinem
res intellectae magis delectant animos, mentes
nutriunt, sensus magis illuminant, &amp; memoriam
reddunt, clariorem.</hi> Such order and course of
Writing doth also procure in the Reader a facility
of apprehension, as <hi>Erasmus</hi> noteth; saying, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliùs

quam quae sparsìm &amp; confusìm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What Order is, St. <hi>Augustine</hi> doth inform us;
saying, <hi>Ordo est parium, dispariumque rerum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributio.</hi>
This Order is twofold; the one of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the other of Discipline: the order of Nature
(as Doctor <hi>Casius</hi> noteth) is a progression from
Simples to things Compound: contrariwise, the
order of Discipline is a proceeding from things
Compound to Simples. As touching the order
that I have prefixed to my self in this Display of
Heraldry, you shall understand, that forasmuch as
the handling of one of these alone, sufficeth not to
the effecting of my intended Method, I must of
force make use of them both in some sort accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their distinct kinds. Wherein albeit the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Nature in right should have the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as the more worthy, <hi>quia Natura regitur
ab intelligentia non errante:</hi> nevertheless in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
my principal purpose tendeth to the prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of a form of Discipline, whereunto these to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
which we call Arms must be reduced, and
therein to manifest rather their Location than
their Generation, their Use than their Essence,
their Shadow than their Substance; I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to prefer the latter (which serveth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
for my purpose) before the former, which
tendeth thereto but collaterally; whose dignity
notwithstanding I purpose regardfully to observe,
when I shall come to the distribution of things
Natural in their proper places.</p>
               <p>But before I enter my Method, I hold it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
(though I do somewhat digress) by way
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55096:8"/>
of introduction to the better conceiving and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of that which shall be herein handled,
briefly to offer to the consideration of the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Reader, some few things of necessary note,
touching the Subject of this Work: Such are
those ensigns or marks which we call Arms in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
and in Latine <hi>Arma;</hi> which being a word
of equivocation or ambiguity, needeth some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication;
<hi>Digredi enim quandoque licet ex cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,
non autem divagari:</hi> for so it is very requisite,
to the end it may be certainly known in what
sense this word is to be here taken, <hi>quia discenti
ponenda sunt vera &amp; certa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is therefore to be observed that this word
<hi>Arma</hi> in Latine is sometimes taken for very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
instruments, and in this sense doth Doctor
<hi>Casius</hi> use the same, where he saith, <hi>Arma belluis
natura dedit, ut Leoni dentes, Serpenti aculeum,
&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes it is taken for all manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
pertaining to Mechanical Trades, as
<hi>Arma Rusticorum, Rastra, Ligones, &amp; hujus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>odi.</hi>
Also <hi>Arma Coquinaria, lebes, patella, tripus,
olla, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Virg. Aeneid.</hi> 5. speaking of the
necessaries pertaining to Shipping, saith, <hi>Colligere
arma jubet, validis<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> incumbere remis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes it is taken for all sorts of warlike
instruments; and in this sense doth Doctor <hi>Casius</hi>
take it, saying, <hi>At hominibus arma industria
finxit, eóque finxit, ut pro imperio rationis eis
uteretur.</hi> But this word <hi>Arma</hi> here meant is not
understood in any of these significations, but must
be taken in a metaphorical sense, for that they do
assume a borrowed name (by way of figure call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Metonymia Subjecti</hi>) from the Shields, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets,
Banners, Military Cassocks, and other Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Instruments, whereupon they were engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
embossed, embroidered or depicted: which
kinds of furniture and habiliments are peculiar
unto Martial men and professed Souldiers, to
whom only it pertaineth to bear Armour; which
even at this day we do usually call by the name
of Arms. And of them in process of time did
these ensigns or marks receive their denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and were called <hi>Arma,</hi> in English Arms, as
<hi>Abra. Fra.</hi> noteth, saying, <hi>Arma appellantur,
quòd olim solis militibus data fuerunt, qui arma
gerere solent. Nam cum ista sit gloria armis, ut
instrumentis comparata, placuit ipsam quoque
mercedem arma appellare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Claudius Fauchet</hi> saith, that Arms have their
Appellation or Denomination, because Military
men bare their Devices, or Inventions depicted
upon their Coat-Armours, and in and upon their
shields: <hi>Claudius Fauchet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Arms were called <hi>Symbola,</hi> which signifieth
Signs, Tokens, or Marks, given in time of Hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
or of Civil Tumults, by Captains to their
Souldiers, or by the Authors of Rebellion to
their pernicious Associates and Confederates, for
distinguishing of particular persons, as well among
themselves, as from their Enemies; for the better
avoiding such inconveniencies (as I shall presently
shew when I come to speak of them, and use of
Arms.)</p>
               <p>These Armorial Notes (so much in use with us
at this day) are oftentimes called <hi>Insignia,</hi> which
name, as <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> supposeth, proceeded of
the barrenness of the Latine tongue; his words
are these, <hi>Insignium nomen ex linguae Latinae
videtur fluxisse inopia, &amp; certè vix aliud vocabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
huic magis quadrat, quod haec praecipuè vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis
&amp; gentilitatis sive nota sive signum sit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How far the extent of this word <hi>Insignia,</hi> or
Ensigns, doth dilate it self, we may perceive by
this, that it compriseth generally all Signs, Marks,
and Tokens of Honour, due to well deserving
persons, either in respect of their Government,
Learning, Wisdom, Magnanimity, &amp;c. These
albeit they have no government annexed to
them, yet have they in them much honour, and
estimation, as were those Pontifical Ornaments,
and Ensigns, wherewith <hi>Simeon</hi> the High Priest
was adorned and furnished at such time as he
went to meet <hi>Alexander,</hi> by means whereof his
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry was appeased. In the like sort did Pope <hi>Leo</hi>
attire himself, when he went to meet <hi>Attila</hi> the
<hi>Scythian</hi> Prince; who having subdued the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and destroyed <hi>Aquileia</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi>
came forwards to <hi>Rome</hi> with like intent. So also
did Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> mitigate the fury of <hi>Totila,</hi> as
if there lurked some secret force and majesty in
the very Ornaments and Ensigns.</p>
               <p>Of the number of these Ensigns, are those
notes, marks, and shapes of Animals, that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
men used to adorn the Crests of their Helm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
withal, to make themselves more eminent in
the Field: and to the end there might be better
notice taken of their valorous actions, when they
encountred their Enemies in Battel: or should
draw on their Forces to fight. Whereof we shall
have cause to speak hereafter in place more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
when we shall come to Treat of them
particularly.</p>
               <p>The use of these was yet extended farther than
the adorning of Shields and Helmets only: For
Ships also and other Navigable Vessels, were also
garnished and beautified in their Fore-decks, yea,
and that in very ancient time, for the distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one Ship from another; as we may see,
<hi>Acts</hi> 28. 11. Where <hi>Paul</hi> saith, he went in a Ship
whose badge was <hi>Castor and Pollux.</hi> Also the
Fore-deck of the Ship that carried away <hi>Europa,</hi>
had a form of a Bull painted thereon, which gave
occasion to the Fable, that a Bull had stollen away
<hi>Europa.</hi> Neither did the Ancients only use this,
but it hath been a received Custome in all Ages
sithence, and yet continued with us unto this day.
Hereof it cometh that we give the Ships the
names of the things that are depicted upon them,
as the Bull, Bear, Lyon, Tyger, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Arms then as they are here meant, according
to their Original and first Use, may be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined:
Arms are tokens or resemblances, signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some act or quality of the Bearer. Or thus,
These Signs called Arms are nothing else but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
and Testimonies of Nobility and of
Worthy prowesful exploits performed in Martial
services, especially if they be ancient, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55096:8"/>
by a Noble and Renowned Prince; And
this is according to their use in the time of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
the Great,</hi> and since, until of later times;
But according to their modern (I mean since the
time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth) and present use,
Arms may be said to be Hieroglyphical or Enig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Symbols or Signs, testifying and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating
the Nobility or Gentry, acquired by the
vertue and good service performed by their Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or some of his Ancestors, either in Martial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
abroad, or by their Learning and Wisdom,
which they attained to, by spending their bodies
and spirits in continual study, to make themselves
fit for the patronage and defence of the Weal-Publick
at home.</p>
               <p>How great the dignity and estimation of Arms
ever hath been, and yet is, we may easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by this, that they do delight the beholders,
and greatly grace and beautifie the places where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are erected; so also they do occasion their
spectators to make serious inquisition, whose they
are, who is the owner of the house wherein they
are set up, of what Family their Bearer is des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
and who were his next, and who are his
remote Parents or Ancestors.</p>
               <p>It is very probable that these Signs, which we
call Arms at this day, howsoever in former Ages
they have been named (whether Emblems or
Pictures, graven, painted, or embossed, or notes
representing some secret or hidden Mystery; as
Hieroglyphicks, or Enigmatical, or hidden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits)
they were external notes of the inward
disposition of the mind, manifesting in some sort
the natural qualities of their Bearers, yet so as
they were hidden from the vulgar sort, and
known to the judicious only, experimented in the
knowledg of the natural vertues and dispositions
of Bodies Celestial, of Animals, and of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>These in their beginning and first institution,
were not bestowed upon vulgar persons, neither
were their intendments fitted for common capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
but such as were extracted out of the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
and very entrails of Nature, and were neither
obscure to the Learned, nor over-familiar to the
Common sort.</p>
               <p>Between Arms and Names there is a certain
conformity, so that as it is a thing unlawful for a
man (but upon great occasion) to change his
name; <hi>Sic neque arma</hi> (saith <hi>Chassan.</hi>) <hi>mutare
licet, nisi magna &amp; honorifica causa accesserit;</hi> and
another saith, <hi>A Nominibus ad Arma bonum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducitur
Argumentum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are sometimes Arms born that may
seem to have been devised (in their first instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
according to the Surnames of the Bearers, as
a Bear for <hi>Vrsonne,</hi> three Castles for <hi>Castleton,</hi>
three Conies for <hi>Conesby,</hi> &amp;c. Whether these be
either better or more ancient than other Arms, it
is a question of more difficulty to be resolved, than
commodious if it were known.</p>
               <p>If there were two distinct Families of one Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name,
yet bearing several Coat-Armours, it is no
consequence that they are originally issued from
the same Ancestours; for their agreement of
their Surnames may be said to be a probability,
but yet it is no proof, that they are both extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the same Ancestours, unless there be
withal a resemblance of their Coat-Armours,
which are the express notes of distinction.</p>
               <p>In case where there are two Families, diverse
in Name, and issued from several Parents; and
both of them do bear one and the self same Coat-Armour,
and the Name of one of them is agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Coat-Armour, and the other dissonant
from the same; the same being in question to
whether of them this Coat doth properly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:
it may be probably conjectured, that he is
interes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed in the Coat-Armour whose appellation
is agreable therewith; rather than he, whose
name hath no conformity with it. For Names
were instituted for differencing of each person
from other severally, according to the saying,
<hi>Sicut Nomina inventa sunt ad cognoscendos ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines:
Ita Arma &amp; Insignia ad recognoscendum
homines sunt inventa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If two men of several Families shall bear one
Coat-Armour, and have their abode in one
Country or Territory; and one of them can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
no more proof why he doth arrogate the
propriety thereof, than the other can; in such
case the cause shall be questioned before the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
or before such as do from him derive their
authority, for the hearing, examining, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
cases of this nature; Otherwise, if
either of them can prove that his Ancestors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the same of the Kings Gift, as a remune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for service done, the Arms shall be adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be his.</p>
               <p>Also there is between these Arms and their
Bearers a kind of Sympathy or natural participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of qualities, insomuch as who so dishonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
or unreverently useth the Arms of any man;
seemeth to have offered indignity to the person
of their Bearer, so as (according to some Authors)
their owner shall right himself against such an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender,
or wrong-doer, <hi>Actione Injuriarum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As touching the Antiquity of these Signs which
we call Arms, <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that <hi>Osyris</hi> surnamed <hi>Iupiter the Iust,</hi> Son
to <hi>Cham</hi> the Cursed Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> called of the
Gentiles <hi>Ianus,</hi> being banished from the blessed
Tents of <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Iaphet;</hi> by reason of the
Curse fallen upon his Father, was constrained to
seek some remote place wherein he might settle
himself, his children, and people: for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he assembled a great Army, and appointed
<hi>Hercules</hi> his Eldest Son Captain. And in this so
ancient an expedition of Wars, as well <hi>Osyris</hi>
himself as <hi>Hercules, Macedon</hi> and <hi>Anubis</hi> his
Sons and others, did Paint certain Signs upon
their Shields, Bucklers, and other Weapons;
which Signs were after called Arms: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<hi>Osyris</hi> bare a Scepter Royal, insigned on
the top with an Eye; <hi>Hercules</hi> a Lion Rampant
holding a Battle-axe; <hi>Macedon</hi> a Wolf, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubis</hi>
a Dog. And we find in <hi>Homer</hi> and in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi>
that the Hero's had their Signs or Marks,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55096:9"/>
whereby their persons were distinctly known, and
discerned in Battel, as well as their Kings and
Commons had their Publick Ensigns: For the
<hi>Athenians</hi> bare the Owl, the <hi>Persians</hi> an Anchor
or Sagittary stamped on their Coins the <hi>Romans</hi>
bare in Eagle, Minotaur, and sundry other shapes,
which (according to <hi>Pliuy</hi>) they bare in Battel
unto the time of <hi>Marius,</hi> who bare in his Ensign
an Eagle, Argent, Figured and Embossed, <hi>Sus une
haute longue,</hi> as may be seen in ancient Medals,
and chiefly in which is found this world, <hi>Allocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> saith, that anciently the
<hi>French</hi> Kings did bear, Argent, three Diadems,
Gules. Others say they bare three Toads, Sable,
in a field, Vert, <hi>alias</hi> Sinople, which cannot be
good Armory, as the Masters of that Mystery do
hold, because of Colour upon Colour.</p>
               <p>Whence they received those Arms is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
known, unless they had them from the
<hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But their opinion is more probable who by the
Blazon of the Shield of <hi>France,</hi> would shew that
the first <hi>Franks</hi> consisting of <hi>Sicambri</hi> (a people
of <hi>Germany,</hi> inhabiting the Marches of <hi>Frizeland</hi>
towards <hi>Holland, Zealand,</hi> and <hi>Gelderland</hi>)
gave unto them Azure, which resembleth the
water (which being calm representeth the colour
of the Heavens) and therein three Flowers <hi>de Lis</hi>
Or, which do grow plentifully in those Marches,
and do flourish in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>Iune.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others affirm, that the same was sent by an
Angel from Heaven to <hi>Clovis,</hi> the first Christian
King of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Tours</hi> in his History mentioned
no such thing, neither doth it appear that they
bare those Arms before the time of King <hi>Pepin,</hi>
but after the time of <hi>Lewis le Grosse:</hi> at which
time it seemeth that Armories began to become
hereditary, and were transferred from Father to
Son in each Family.</p>
               <p>In the first assumption of these Signs, every
man did take to himself some such Beast, Bird,
Fish, Serpent, or other Creature as he thought
best fitted his Estate, or whose nature and quality
did in some sort quadrate with his own, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
himself was in some respect in quality like,
or wished to be resembled unto. <hi>Ex iis quibus
quisque maxime delectatur qualis etiam sit ipse
cognoscitur.</hi> The reason is, for that no man is
delighted but with things that are like himself.
Therefore wherein any man is specially delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
himself also is found to be in quality much like
unto them. Zanchius <hi>de immortalitate Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum</hi> 133.</p>
               <p>Whereof it cometh that our Souls albeit they are
naturally delighted with things that please, and
delight the External Senses, yet shall we find that
by how much the mind is more generous and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by so much the more doth it apprehend a
more solid delight in things pertaining to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
faculties, than in such as pertain to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
senses, as we may see in those Arts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Phantasie is chiefly exercised; whereby
they receive a greater contentment of things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to the mind, that is to say, as well Moral,
as Natural, and Supernatural Philosophy. For
like as our exteriour senses are delighted with
corporal, and corruptible things; so in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
are our minds affected to things Spiritual and
eternal, and are wonderfully delighted in them
by reason of the Sympathy of their natural qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.
<hi>Similitudo non currit quatuor pedibus
(ut aiunt in Scholis</hi>) many things may be like,
yet nothing like in all points or respects.</p>
               <p>As their Institution is not new, but very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
derived almost from the beginning of the
world; so their use was not limited, or restrained
to some few particular Nations, Kingdoms and
Countries, but most largely spread all the World
over, insomuch, as there is no Nation, Country
or People, so savage or barbarous, but that they
have their particular Signs, whereby they may
particularly and distinctly be known and discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from others. As in Example.</p>

and shapes of savage and cruel beasts, as also their
Targets, and other Military Instruments suited
accordingly, and that in such multitudes, and in
such glorious and glistering manner, that they
dazled the eyes of the beholders.</p>
               <p>Neither were these Signs particularly restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto Nations, Countries, and Provinces but
they were so universal, as that there was no
Tribe, particular Person or Family, but had their
Armorial Signs or Notes, whereby they were not
only distinctly known, and discerned from other
forreign Tribes and Families; but also apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discerned (amongst themselves) one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by means of interposition of some minute
or small differences, which after-comers were
forced to devise for the preservation of Common
peace and unity, when the multitude of Bearers
(through long tract of time) increased exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively.</p>

the Celestial Spheres, the Scituation of the Earth,
and the adjacent Islands, the Seas with the ebbing

better occasion offered to speak more at large
hereafter. Also <hi>Amphiaraus</hi> (as <hi>Pindarus</hi> the

overpass.</p>
               <p>These Signs or Tokens were in their first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
rough-hewen (as I may term them)
and rude, as also those other notes of signs that
we now call Badges or Cognizances: so as they
may be said to have been rather painted Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems,
than exquisite tokens of honour, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
signs or badges: in the time of their first
institution they received divers denominations,
as Signs, Ensigns, Tokens, Marks, Cognizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when in After-ages they had
been polished and refined, then were these To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
or Signs, that had been formerly (after a
rude fashion) handled together, more carefully
distinguished, so as those which we now call
Crests or Cognizances, worn upon the helmets
of Military persons in the field, were distinctly
known from those that were born in the Shields
and Targets, which we now call Arms in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
and in Latin <hi>Arma.</hi> Men of ancient times
devised and invented many things ingenuously
and with great care and consideration, but fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
them not; but recommended them to
posterity, to be by them brought to perfection,
according to that saying, <hi>Invenit antiquitas,
posteri perfecerunt,</hi> neither doth this derogate
ought from the studious, and industry of the
Ancient, neither is this any indignity unto them;
<hi>Non erubescat antiquitas</hi> (saith <hi>Chassaneus</hi>) <hi>si
quid melius horum quae ipsa tradidit, Novitas
adinvenit:</hi> for nothing is devised and perfected
at an instant, but it is continuance of time, and
much labour and industry that brings it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>These Signs, Marks, Notes, Ensigns, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
else you please to name them, are not all
of one sort, for some of them may be applied
to peace, and others to military use; and of
each of these there are divers kinds or sorts:
For some of them are express notes of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and authority or jurisdiction, others have
no authority at all annexed to them.</p>
               <p>Like as there is an absolute Authority or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
Royal, free from all limitation, and
another said to be a mixt government; yea, and
that as well in Civil Policy, as in Ecclesiastical
Jurisdiction: so are also the Ensigns several, as
well those that pertain to the City, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
as also those that belong to Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Government.</p>
               <p>Those Ensigns that are remote or exempted
from Government and Authority are diverse,
according to the diversity of conceipts of the
first institutors or devisers of them. For some
of them are in manner Vulgar and Common,
and such as may fall to the lot of a person of
mean condition: others again of more subtile
and deep invention; exquisite, beautiful, and
honourable, and are remunerations or rewards
of some noble exploits, of meer divine wits, or
of some rare or excellent vertue, as a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of memorable and worthy deserts.</p>
               <p>I know some are of opinion that these tokens
or signs, which we do call Arms, were utterly
unknown to the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi>
and their memory not to be found with their
Nations: They do confess that the <hi>Romans</hi> did
make the same use of their Images that we do
at this day by our Arms, <hi>viz.</hi> to produce them
for testimonies of their generous race.</p>
               <p>Some other are of opinion, that they were
excogitated and brought in use by <hi>Charles</hi> the
Great and the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and some again do
suppose, they began in the time of <hi>Frederick
Barbarossa,</hi> but the contrary appeareth by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical
proof, as I have even now shewed:
well may their opinion stand with reason, that
do hold, that the discipline of Arms in the
Reign (or rather) during Imperial Government
of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the
Great, was brought to some kind of perfection,
and withal more generally propagated and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed,
according to that saying of <hi>Abra. Fra.</hi>
Carolo <hi>Potentissimo Imperante haec &amp; distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ùs
explicata fuisse, &amp; frequentiùs usurpata elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cescit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The principal end for which these signs were
first taken up, and put in use was, that they
might serve for notes and marks to distinguish
tribes, families, and particular persons, each
from other; but this was not their only use, for
that they served also to notifie to the ingenuous
beholder of them (after some sort) the natural
quality and disposition of their Bearers; and so
behooveful was this invention thought to be,
and their use so reasonable, as that they have
been entertained of all succeeding posterities,
among all Nations, and continued (even to this
day) without any immutation or alteration of
their primary institution. These Armorial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
thus ingeniously devised had a further use;
for they served also for the more commodious
distribution of Nations, Tribes, and Families,
into Regiments and Bands; as also for assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
conducting, and governing of them in
martial expedition, and distinguishing (as I
have shewed) of particular persons in wars, as
well amongst themselves as from their enemies;
because it often falleth out by reason of the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Armour and Weapons, of Discipline of
War, and of Language and Voice (in default of
such signs) that much treachery is wrought, and
many men after battle or skirmish do make
their retreat to the troops of the Enemy, to the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55096:10"/>
danger of their surprise, or loss of life: So then
it is clear that this is one use of these Notes, or
Marks of distinction called Arms, that if a man
shall meet or encounter us, we do forthwith dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
by the note or mark that he beareth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be friend or enemy; and for some of
those uses and ends which I have formerly
shewed, These Armorial Ensigns have received
approbation in the highest degree, even from
the mouth of God himself (who, when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
unto <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> a Form of order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and conducting the <hi>Israelites</hi> in their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
towards the Land of the Promise, did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
command the use of Armorial Signs, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Filii Israelis quisque juxta vexillum su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
cum signis secundum domum Majorum suorum
castra habento:</hi> which order he required to be
observed not only in the conduction of them in
their journey, but also in the pitching and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of their Camp.</p>
               <p>In which precept we may observe, that God
maketh mention of two sorts of Ensigns; the
one general, the other particular; and that these
latter were no less needful than the former; for
the orderly governing and conducting of so
huge and populous a multitude as the <hi>Israelites</hi>
were, in a journey so long, and withal subject
to infinite dangers. The first sort of these En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
God calleth <hi>Vexilla,</hi> that is to say Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
or Banners, which served for the conducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their several Regiments. For the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
consisted of twelve Tribes which were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into four Regiments; that is, to wit, three
Tribes to each Regiment, of which every one
had a particular Standard, which as they differed
in colour one from another, so did they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
comprehend in them several and distinct
Forms.</p>
               <p>Here may arise a twofold question concerning
these Standards before mentioned; the one,
what colour each of them were; the other,
what forms and shapes were depicted on them.
As to the colour, <hi>Lyra</hi> upon the second of <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
saith, <hi>Qualia sunt ista Vexilla in Textu
non habetur, sed dicunt aliqui Hebraei quod
Vexillum cujuslibet Tribus, erat simile colori
lapidis positi in rationali, in quo inscriptum e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
nomen ipsius</hi> Reuben, <hi>&amp; sic de aliis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to their several Forms, <hi>Martinus
Borhaus</hi> in his Commentary upon the same
place, hath this saying, <hi>Tradunt Veteres in</hi>
Reubenis <hi>vexillo Mandragoram depictam fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isse,
quam ille in agro collectam matri</hi> Liae <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulerat;
in</hi> Jehudae <hi>Leonem, cui illum benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendo

Imago, qui serpenti &amp; colubro a</hi> Jacobo
<hi>comparatus erat, fiat</hi> Dan <hi>coluber in via.</hi> And
in Conclusion he saith, <hi>Sit fides penes Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This sort of Ensign according to <hi>Calepine,</hi> is
called <hi>Vexillum quasi parvum velum, &amp; acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitur</hi>
(saith he) <hi>pro signo quo in exercitu vel
classe Imperatores utuntur.</hi> The use of these
Standards doth consist herein, that they being
born aloft upon a long pole or staff apparent to
every mans view, the Souldiers may be thereby
directed (upon all occasions of service) and by
the sight of them may be dissevered and united
at all times, as the necessity of the service shall
require. Of this use, <hi>Lyra</hi> upon the second
of <hi>Numbers</hi> saith, <hi>Vexilla in perticis elevan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
ut ad eorum aspectum bellatores dividan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
&amp; uniantur:</hi> for like as a Ship is guided in
the surging Seas by the Stern or Ruther, even
so are the Souldiers ordered in their Martial
Exploits by their Standard or Ensign.</p>
               <p>The other sorts of Ensigns God calleth <hi>Signa
secundum domum Majorum suorum:</hi> whereby
is meant (if I be not deceived) the particular
Ensigns or Tokens of each particular Family,
and of the particular persons of each Family.
For so do I understand that exposition of <hi>Lyra</hi>
upon the same place, <hi>Signa propria sunt in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stibus
&amp; scutis, quibus bellatores mutuò se
cognoscunt, &amp; suos ab Adversariis distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here we must put a difference between
these words <hi>Arma &amp; Insignia,</hi> and we must se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
those things that are proper to Arms
from such as pertain to Ensigns.</p>
               <p>Arms therefore being taken in the largest
sense (as I have hitherto in this Discourse used
the word) may be said to be either Publick or
Private.</p>
               <p>Such are said to be Publick Arms, as have
some Soveraign authority or jurisdiction annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them.</p>
               <p>Of the first sort are such Arms as are born by
Emperours, Kings, and absolute Princes, and
free Estates, having Soveraign authority and
power within their several Empires, Kingdoms,
and Territories. These in propriety of speech
cannot be aptly said to be the Arms of their
Stock or Family, whereof they are descended,
but do rather represent the nature of Ensigns,
than of Arms, in regard of the publick autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to them annexed; as also in respect that
whosoever shall succeed them in those supream
Governments shall bear the same Arms, as the
express Notes and Testimonies of such their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Jurisdictions, though they be extracted
from Aliens or forraign Families. For so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the Eagle the peculiar Arms of the house
of <hi>Austria,</hi> nor the Lions of the Family of
<hi>Plantagenet,</hi> nor the Flowers de Lis of the
house of <hi>Valois.</hi> And these Arms or Ensigns
may no man else bear, or yet mark his Goods
withal, unless it be that in token of Loyalty he
will set up the Kings Arms in his house, and
place his own Arms underneath. And there
are certain Ensigns of Dignity and Office which
every man having the same Dignity or Office
may lawfully bear, as the Ensigns of a Procon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,
the Ensigns of a Bishop. And these are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to those only that have the exercising of
such Dignity or Office; if any other shall ufurp
the bearing or use of them, he incurreth the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55096:10"/>
crime of Forgery. Private Arms are such as
are proper to Private persons, whether they
be numbred in rank of the greater Nobility, as
Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,
having no soveraign or absolute power:
or of the lesser Nobility or Gentry, Knights,
Esquires and Gentlemen; neither yet are they
Ensigns of any ordinary dignity, but peculiar to
their Family, and may be infinitely transferred
to their Posterity.</p>
               <p>For Arms or Armorial Tokens pertaining to
some particular Family; do descend to every
peculiar person extracted from the same Agna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whether they be heirs to their Father or
Grandfather, or not. Sometimes the bearers
of these do so greatly multiply, as that they
are constrained for distinction sake, to annex
some apposition over and above their Paternal
Coat to them descended, for differencing the
persons. <hi>Quod licitum est, sicut nomini addere
praenomen,</hi> which they may no less lawfully do,
than to add a Christian name to a Surname, to
distinguish two Children issued from one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
               <p>These Arms are sometimes composed of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
things, as of some kinds of Celestial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<hi>viz.</hi> of the Sun, Moon, Stars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of four footed Beasts, or of Birds, or of
Serpents, or of Fishes, or some other Reptiles,
or else of some kind of Vegetables, as Trees,
Shrubs, Flowers, Fruits, Leaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or else
of some solid things, as Castles, Towers, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or of things pertaining to Arts
Liberal, or Trades Mechanical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
again they are compact of none of these,
but do consist only of the variations of simple
Colours, counterchanged by occasion of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
Perpendicular, or whatsoever other Line
used in Coat-Armour, whether the same be
Straight, Crooked, Bunched, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereby
passing through the Escocheon, either Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
Oblique, or Direct, the Colours become
transmuted or counterchanged; of all which I
shall have occasion to speak hereafter in their
particular place.</p>
               <p>If question happen to arise touching the right
of some desolate place, or ruinated building, if
in digging up the ruines, or taking up of the
foundation thereof, there be found any known
Coat-Armour; the questioned place shall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
to appertain to that Family, to whom
that Coat-Armour belongeth.</p>
               <p>If any man be attainted or convicted of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
for betraying his Country, or of Heresie,
to the end he should be branded with a greater
note of infamy, his Arms are rased, broken
down and utterly defaced.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it falleth out that if a Noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
be extinguished by the death of the last of
the same (deceasing without issue) whereby the
bearing of the Arms proper to that Lineage is
from thenceforth abolished: The Arms are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred
in the grave, together with the Corps of
the Defunct.</p>
               <p>After long tract of time, these Tokens which
we call Arms, became remunerations for service,
and were bestowed by Emperours, Kings, and
Princes, and their Generals and chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
in the field upon Martial men, whose
valorous merits even in justice, required due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of Honour answerable unto their
worthy acts, the remembrance whereof could
not better be preserved and derived unto poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
than by these kinds of honourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
The first we read of, that made this
use of them was <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, being
moved thereunto by the perswasion of <hi>Aristotle</hi>
his Schoolmaster: who having observed his
magnificent mind in rewarding his Souldiers to
the full of their deserts, did at length prevail
with him so much, as that he caused him to
turn the Current of his Bounty another way,
and to recompence his Souldiers with these
Marks or Tokens of Honour; which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on them as Hereditary testimonies of
their glorious merits. In later Ages <hi>Charles</hi>
the Fourth the Emperour, gave Arms also un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Learned men, and such as had performed any
memorable service, or excellent work, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Bartholus,</hi> being a most expert man in
the Laws, and one of the Council of the said
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, received in reward for his
Arms from the said Emperour, this Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
<hi>viz.</hi> Or, a Lion rampant his tail forked,
Gules, which afterward descended successively
to his Children and Posterity. But <hi>Bartholus</hi>
(though he were a most singular and perfect
Civilian) because he was unexperienced in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Discipline, durst not at first assume the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of those Arms: But afterwards upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
advice he bare them, knowing how unfit it
was to refuse a Reward given by so Potent an
Emperour. And this was a noble Institution of
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, that not only the Skilful
Professors of the Civil Laws, but the Learned
Proficients, and the Judicious Students in other
Arts and Professions, might receive remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for their Vertues, <hi>Honos enim alit Artes,
omnesque incenduntur ad studia glori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, Abra.
Fra. pag.</hi> 76. And without all doubt there is
great reason that Arms should be distributed
unto men renowned for their Learning and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
who with expence, even of their Lives
and Spirits in continual Study, to enable them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
fit for to serve the Weal publick at home,
by Magistracy, and Civil Government, wherein
they may no less merit reward of their Prince
at home, by their politick managing of Civil
Affairs, than the Martial man abroad with his
brandished slaughtering Sword; sithence they
oftentimes in their Civil Government, do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
limits to Martial affairs also, how far they
shall extend their power, according to that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Cicero; Offic. 1. Parvi sunt foris Arma,
nisi est consilium domi</hi> And this is the cause
that Arms are given for remuneration in later
times, as well to Learned and Religious men,
as to Martial men; yet not so much for their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55096:11"/>
valour, as for their wisdom, and to honour
them withal, according to the saying of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Author, <hi>Arma dantur viris Religiosis,
non propter strenuitatem, sed propter honorem,
quia honorabile est Arma portare; ut Doctor
in legibus viginti annis per legem Armorum fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
Miles, non tamen propter ejus strenuitatem,
sed propter ejus dignitatem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The examples of these two Great Potentates
before mentioned, in remunerating their well
meriting Souldiers, faithful Servants and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and learned Subjects, with these Signs or
Symbols called Arms; the one, <hi>viz. Alexander</hi>
the Great, for service done in Wars; the other,
namely <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth, for politick mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of Civil Affairs by learning and wisdom at
home, have been imitated by divers Emperors,
Kings and Princes of succeeding Ages, using
therein the ministry of the Office of Heralds;
as subordinate Officers thereunto appointed
and authorized, reserving always to themselves
the supream jurisdiction of Judging and Remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating
persons according to their Deserts;
but using the ministry of the Heralds, as for
sundry other uses of great importance in a
State, so also for the inventing and devising of
congruent tokens of Honour, answerable to the
merits of those that shall receive the same: to
do which although there is a power seeming ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
committed to them by the Soveraign;
yet the same is restrained into a power ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which is to devise with discretion Arms,
correspondent to the desert of the person, that
shall be thought worthy to have these honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
badges or tokens of honour bestowed upon
him.</p>
               <p>Now sithence we have had cause here in this
Chapter to make mention of a Herald, it shall
not be amiss to shew what this word is, and its
natural signification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here-heaulte.</hi> by abbreviation (as <hi>Verstegan</hi>
noteth) <hi>Herault,</hi> as also <hi>Herauld,</hi> doth rightly
signifie the Champion of the Army; and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be a Name of Office, he that in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
hath the special charge to denounce Wars,
or to challenge to Battle or Combat: in which
sense our name of <hi>Heraulte</hi> approacheth the
nearest to <hi>Fecialis</hi> in Latin.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>SO much of such Notes as are necessary to
be observed for the better understanding
of these things that shall be hereafter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
touching the Subject of this Work.
Now we proceed to the practick exercise of
these Armorial tokens, which pertain to the
function of Heralds, and is termed Armory, and
may be thus defined: Armory is an Art right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prescribing the true knowledg and use of
Arms.</p>
               <p>Now like as in things natural the effects do
evermore immediately ensue their causes, even
so division which is a demonstration of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and power of things, must by immediate
consequence follow definition, which doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the nature of the thing defined. Division
is a distribution of things common, into things
particular or less common. The use thereof
consisteth herein, that by the assistance of this
division, words of large intendment and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
are reduced to their definite and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
sense and meaning, that so the mind of
the learner be not misled through the ambiguity
of words, either of manifold or uncertain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations.
Moreover it serveth to illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
the understanding of the learner, and to
make him more capable of such things as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
<hi>Ea enim quae divisim traduntur facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
intelliguntur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The practise hereof shall be manifested in
the distribution of the skill of Armory, with
all the parts and complements thereof through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this whole Work.</p>
               <p>This Skill of Armory consists of Blazoning,
and
Marshalling.</p>
               <p>Albeit I do here make mention of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalling,
or conjoyning of divers Arms in one
Shield, or Escocheon; nevertheless, sithence it
is far besides my purpose, for the present to have
further to do with them (in this place) than on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to nominate them; for distributions sake, I
will reserve this kind of Marshalling or conjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Arms of distinct Families in one Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheon,
unto a more convenient time and
place, peculiarly destinated to that purpose, and
I will proceed to the explication of those things
which do concern the first member of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution,
<hi>viz.</hi> Blazoning.</p>
               <p>Blazon is taken, either strictly for an explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Arms in apt and significant terms, or
else, it is taken largely for a display of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of the Bearers of Arms: in which sense
<hi>Chassaneus</hi> defineth the same in this manner,
<hi>Blazonia est quasi alicujus vera laudatio sub
quibusdam signis, secundum prudentiam, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,
fortitudinem &amp; temperantiam.</hi> A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
French Armorist saith, that to Blazon is to
express what the shapes, kinds, and colour of
things born in Arms are, together with their apt
significations.</p>
               <p>Like as definitions are forerunners of divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
even so divisions also have precedence of
rules. To speak properly of a rule, it may be
said to be any straight or level thing, whereby
lines are drawn in a direct and even form. In
resemblance whereof, we here understand it,
to be a brief precept or instruction for knowing
or doing of things aright, as witnesseth <hi>Calepine,</hi>
saying, <hi>Regula per translationem dicitur, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis
rerum praeceptio,</hi> that is to say, a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
or ready instruction of matters.</p>
               <p>Rules are taken for brief documents prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
for the delivery, or apprehension of some
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55096:11"/>
Art or Science; by these the wits and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of men are much comforted and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
according to the saying of <hi>Seneca, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genii
vis praeceptis alitur &amp; crescit, non ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
quam scintilla flatu levi adjuta, novas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
persuasiones adjicit innatis, &amp; depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatas
corrigit.</hi> The force of wit is nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and augmented by Rules or Precepts;
like as a spark is kindled with a soft and
gentle fire, and do add new inducements and
perswasions to those that are already appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
and correcteth such as are depraved
and vicious.</p>
               <p>It followeth therefore, by due order of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
that I should annex such Rules as
are peculiar to blazon <hi>in genere.</hi> For other
particular Rules must be reserved to more
proper places.</p>
               <p>The aptest Rules for this place, are these
immediately following: In Blazoning you must
use an advised deliberation before you enter
thereunto; for having once begun, to recal
the same, doth argue an inconsiderate for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness
meriting just reprehension.</p>
               <p>The more compendious your Blazon is, by
so much is it holden the more commendable;
<hi>Quia quod brevius est semper delectabilius
habetur.</hi> Therefore you must shun multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of impertinent words in your Blazon,
<hi>Frustra enim fit per plura quod fieri potest
per pauciora.</hi> But herein you must observe
this Caution, that whilst you labour to be
compendious, you omit nothing material or
necessary to be expressed: For as the one doth
eclipse the understanding, so the other is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
to memory, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> noteth, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Omnis sermo, si sit brevior quam opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet,
obscurat intellectum, si autem longior,
difficile erit retentioni.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You must take special heed to words in
Blazon, for a different form in Blazoning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the Arms cease to be the same; <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitas
enim nominis inducet diversitatem
rei, in tantum quod nomina sunt significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va
rerum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You must not be too full of conceits in Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,
nor overforward in speech.</p>
               <p>You must use no iteration or repetition of
words in Blazoning of one Coat:</p>
               <p>Especially of any of these four
words, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>Of,</item>
                     <item>Or,</item>
                     <item>And,</item>
                     <item>With.</item>
                  </list>
For the doubling of any of these, is counted
a great fault, insomuch as the offender here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is deemed unworthy to Blazon a Coat-Armour.</p>
               <p>In Blazoning you must have regard of the
things that are born in Arms: as also where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they may be resembled, whether they
be natural or artificial, and so to commend
them accordingly.</p>
               <p>In the Blazoning of any Coat, you must e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore
observe this special Rule. First to
begin with the Field, and then proceed to
the Blazon of the Charge, if any be. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
if the Field be occupied with sundry
things, whether the same be of one or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
kinds, you must first nominate that which
lieth next and immediately upon the Field,
and then Blazon that which is more remote
from the same. What Field and Charge are
shall be shewed in their proper places; <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim
oportet discentem credere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chassaneus</hi> holdeth, that where the Chief
of an Escocheon is of one colour or metal,
or more, you shall blazon the Chief first;
but I hold it more consonant to reason, to
begin with the Field (because of the priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thereof in nature, as also in respect that
it is the Continent) rather than with the
Charge, which is the thing contained, and
so consequently last in nature. Nevertheless
the French Armorists for the most part do bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon
the Charge first, and the Field after,
which is a course meerly repugnant to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
by whose prescript order, the place
must have precedence of the thing placed,
and the continent of the thing contained:
wherefore our Heralds manner of blazon is
more agreable to reason than theirs. There
be divers forms of blazon: A certain Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who lived in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi>
the Fifth, used to blaze Arms by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
parts of mans body, as <hi>Ab. Fra.</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
<hi>pag. 63. Malorques,</hi> a French-man,
made use of flowers for this purpose. <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi>
an English-man, who lived in the time
of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, performed it by
the days of the week. But in former times their
Predecessors used only these three kinds follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
first, by Metals and Colours; secondly, by
precious Stones; and thirdly, by the Celestial
Planets. Out of which sundry forms, I have
made choice of these three last which are
most ancient and necessary, in respect that
these, above all other, do best fit my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
which is, to apply to each particular
state of Gentry, a blazon Correspondent.
As for example, to Gentlemen having no
title of dignity, blazon by Metals and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours:
to persons ennobled by the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign,
by precious Stones: and to Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
Monarchs, Kings and Princes, blazon by
Planets.</p>
               <p>The two last of these three selected forms
are not to be used in the blazoning of the
Coat-Armours of Gentlemen that are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to some degree of Nobility, unless they
be rarely qualified, or of special desert.</p>
               <p>These selected forms of blazon, do seem to
imply a necessity of their invention; to the end
that as well by blazon, as by degree, Noblemen
might be distinguished from Gentlemen, and
persons of Majesty, from those of Noble
Lineage, that so a due <hi>Decorum</hi> may be
observed in each Degree, according to the
Dignity of their Persons; for that it is a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55096:12"/>
thing unfitting, either to handle a mean Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
in a lofty stile, or a stately Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in a mean.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>SO much of the Definition and general
Rules of Blazon. Now will I proceed
to the distribution thereof.</p>
               <p>The principal means of teaching, and the
chief part of Method consisteth in distinction,
therefore in the explanation or unfolding of
this Fabrick of Arms or Armorial Signs, I
will use some manifest kind of distribution.</p>
               <p>The blazon of <hi>Arms</hi> consisteth
in their Accidents,
and
Parts.</p>
               <p>I call those notes or marks Accidents of
Arms, that have no inherent quality or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of the Substance or Essence of them,
but may be annexed unto them, or taken
from them, their Substance still remaining;
for so doth <hi>Porphyrius</hi> define the same, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Accidens potest adesse &amp; abesse sine sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecti
interitu.</hi> Accidents may be said to be
Cosin-germans to Nothing: For so, after a
sort, doth <hi>Aristotle</hi> reckon of them, saying,
<hi>Accidens videtur esse propinquum non enti,
Metaph.</hi> 6. For they have no being of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but as they are in things of being, or
annexed to them. As the same Author fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
noteth, <hi>Metaph. 7. Accidentia non sunt
entia, nisi quia sunt entis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Accidents and Forms do agree in this point,
that both the one and the other of them
being separated from the Substance, yet is not
the Substance thereby altered from that it
was, but remaineth still the same; which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
many men to think that Forms were
Accidents. These cannot alter the matter
or substance, because they are not of the
main, but come upon the by, as it were.
<hi>Nihil enim transmutat materiam, nisi sit in
materia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Accidents are in the subject,, as <hi>passio in
patiente,</hi> according to that saying, <hi>Accidens
ut est in subjecto, non idem est in subjecto,
sed ut est passio ejus, est sibi idem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such Accidents as are here meant
are these, <hi>viz.</hi> Tincture,
and
Differences.</p>
               <p>Tincture is a variable hue of Arms, and
is common, as well to Differences of Arms, as
to the Arms themselves.</p>
               <p>And the same is distributed into Colours,
and
Furrs.</p>
               <p>Colour may be said to be an external die,
wherewith any thing is coloured or stained,
or else it may be said to be the gloss of a
Body beautified with light.</p>
               <p>And the Colour here mentioned is
both General,
and
Special.</p>
               <p>By general Colour, I understand the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and natural colour of each particular
thing, whether the same be Natural or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial,
of what kind soever that are depicted
and set forth in their external and proper
beauty. In this respect all colours whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
(without exception) may seem to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to this Art, for so much as there is
nothing in this world subjected to the sight
of man, but either is, or aptly may be born
in Arms; so spacious and general is the scope
of Armory. In blazoning of things born in
their natural or proper colour, you shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
term them to be born proper, which is a
blazon sufficient for things of that kind, and
well fitting their property or nature, for
there are no terms of blazon allowed to things
born after that sort.</p>
               <p>By special Colours, I mean such colours,
as by a certain peculiar propriety (as it were)
do belong to this Art of Armory.</p>
               <p>These are both
 Simple,
and
Mixt.</p>
               <p>Simple Colours are those, whose existence
is of such absolute perfection (in their kind)
as that they need not the participation of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other colour to make them absolute, but
do communicate their natural qualities to all
other colours, to make them perfect, in which
respect they are called <hi>elementa coloris,</hi> as
shall be shewed hereafter.</p>
               <p>And those are White,
and Black.</p>
               <p>To these in right belongeth the first place
amongst colours, because in the order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
they were before all other colours: <hi>Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra
enim sunt compositis incomposita:</hi> and are
of <hi>Aristotle</hi> called <hi>Elementa colorum,</hi> saying,
<hi>Albus &amp; niger sunt elementa colorum medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum.</hi>
Only White and Black are accounted
simple Colours, because all other colours what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
are raised either of an equal or une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
mixture or composition of these two,
which are (as I may term them) their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
parents. These are said to be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
parents of all other colours, in respect
they have their original being from these,
either in an equal or disproportionable mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Therefore I will begin with them,
and so proceed to the rest that we call <hi>colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
medii,</hi> in respect of their participation of
both. Now for as much as practise is the
scope of Doctrines (to the end those things
that are, or shall be delivered, may be the
better conceived or born in memory) I have
thought good to manifest them by particular
examples of ocular demonstration, in the plainest
manner that I can devise, <hi>Quia qualis est rerum
demonstratio, talis futura est hominum scientia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:55096:12"/>Examples and Demonstrations are of
great power and efficacy to illustrate and
bring things to light, wherein brevity, the
prop and aid of memory and sweet compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of facility, is highly commended, as <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesius</hi>
noteth, saying, <hi>Nihil est ad res illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minandas
illustrius exemplis, in quibus bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitas
adjutrix memoriae, facilitatis socia,
semper est commendata.</hi>
               </p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The colour White is resembled to the
light, and the dignity thereof reckoned more
worthy than the Black, by how much the
light and the day is of more esteem than dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and the night, whereunto black is likened.
Furthermore, white is accounted more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
than black, in respect of the more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
use thereof. For men in ancient time
were accustomed to note things well and
laudably performed (and esteemed worthy to
be kept in memory) with white, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise,
whatsoever was holden reproachful
or dishonourable, was noted with black, as the
Poet noteth, saying,
<q>
                     <l>Quae laudanda forent, &amp; quae culpanda vicissim,</l>
                     <l>Illa prius cretâ, mox haec carbone notasti.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, white challengeth the preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of black (according to <hi>Vpton</hi>) in respect
of the priority of time, for that it was in
nature before black, which is a deprivation
thereof: Like as darkness, whereunto black
is resembled, is an exemption of light, <hi>Omnis
enim privatio praesupponit habitum.</hi> Finally,
<hi>Vpton</hi> preferreth white before black, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that white is more easily discerned, and
further seen in the Field.</p>
               <p>This colour is most commonly taken in
Blazon for the metal Silver, and is termed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
wheresoever the same is found, either
in Field or Charge. This metal representeth
Water, which (next to the Air) is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
of all the Elements, and in Armory it
is termed Argent, for that it approacheth
near to the Luminary Bodies. To this metal
is given the second place next to Gold, in
regard that the Armory cannot be good, that
hath not in it either <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Silver:</hi> It
also, for another cause, bare the resemblance
of Water, which scoureth, cleanseth, and
putteth away all filth and uncleanness: For
in Blazon it betokeneth innocency, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of life and chastity; amongst Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
it is likened to flegm. As for the esteem
of this metal Silver, we may observe in all
Ages, that Emperours, Kings, and Princes
had, and yet have, their Vessels of chief use
of Silver. As for the abundance of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
you may read 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9. how every
man brought unto <hi>Solomon</hi> presents, being
<hi>Vessels of Silver and Vessels of Gold, and
Rayment and Armour, and sweet Odors,
Horses and Mules from year to year. And
the King gave Silver in Ierusalem as Stones,
&amp;c.</hi> Such was the plentiful abundance of
this metal in the days of <hi>Solomon.</hi> In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of Arms, it is accounted a fault wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
blame to Blazon this otherwise than Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;
but in doubling of Mantles it is not
so taken: for therein it is not understood
to be a metal, but the skin or furr of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Beast called a <hi>Lituite,</hi> so named (as I
conceive) of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> now called <hi>Luten,</hi> a
part of <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> confining upon <hi>Polonia.</hi>
This Furr hath been heretofore much used
by the ancient Matrons of the honourable Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>London,</hi> even by those that were of
the chiefest account, who ware the same in a
kind of Bonnet, called corruptly a <hi>Lettice Cap.</hi>
               </p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Now as touching <hi>Colores medii,</hi> or mixed
Colours, it is to be understood that they are
raised by the contemperation or mixture of the
two Simples formerly handled, as may appear
by the Definition of <hi>Scribonius,</hi> who saith,
<hi>Mixtus color est, qui ex Simplicium contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratione
producitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All mixt or midling Colours, that we call
<hi>Colores medii,</hi> are reckoned more Noble, or
Ignoble, by participation; that is to say, as
they do partake more or less of the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of white, which is resembled to light;
or of black, which hath a resemblance of
darkness, or deprivation of light.</p>
               <p>Of these according to <hi>Scribonius,</hi> some are <list>
                     <item>Exactly compounded of
both Simples.</item>
                     <item>Declining more to the
one than to the other, in
an unequal proportion.</item>

               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>Purpure Colour hath some resemblance of
a withered red Rose, which after long ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering,
the glorious lustre thereof fading,
becometh somewhat blackish, as if it
were a proportionable commixture of Red
and Black together. This Colour hath its
Denomination of a certain Fish called in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
<hi>Purpura,</hi> a kind of Shell-fish, whereof
in times past, great store have been found
near to that famous City of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> situated
next to the Sea-coast in the Country of
<hi>Phoeuicia:</hi> this kind of Fish hath in the mouth
of it an excellent and precious liquor, or juyce,
of singular use in dying of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>loaths, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
and use whereof was first found out
by the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> for which cause this Colour
is called <hi>Tyrius Color.</hi> They must be taken
alive, and that chiefly in the Spring Season,
at which time the juyce is most plentiful in
them at other Seasons it is more scarce:
They are gathered alive, and cast together
on a heap, that so by their continual moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they may vent out this rich liquor toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with their spirit, which done in some
near place or other provided for the clean
keeping thereof, it is taken up and spared
for necessary purposes. This <hi>Colour,</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
time, was of that precious esteem, as
that none but Kings and Princes, and their
Favourites, might wear the same, as we may
see, <hi>Dan. 5. 16. Now if thou canst read the
writing, and shew me the interpretation
thereof, thou shalt be clothed with Purple,
and shalt have a chain of Gold about thy
neck.</hi> Also, 1 <hi>Macchab. 10. 20. And</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander
<hi>sent</hi> Jonathan <hi>a Purple Robe, and a
Crown of Gold.</hi> And again; <hi>When his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers
saw his Honour as it was proclaimed,
and that he was cloathed in Purple, they
fled all away.</hi> Hereof (perhaps) it cometh
that this Colour is found of so rare use in
Armorial Signs. Moreover it is said; <hi>And
the King commanded that they should take
off the Garment of</hi> Jonathan, <hi>and cloath him
in Purple, and so they did, 1 Macchab.</hi> 10.

of Furrs, according to the Series and
Course of our Distribution before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
<hi>pag.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Furrs (used in Arms) are taken for the
Skins of certain Beasts, stripped from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and artificially trimmed, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
doubling, or lining of Robes and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
serving as well for State and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence,
as for wholsome and necessary use.
And these thus trimmed and imployed, are
called in Latin <hi>pellicei, à pellendo,</hi> of driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away, (quite contrary in sense, though
like in sound, to <hi>pellices, à pellicendo,</hi> for
drawing all to them) because they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
and resist the extremities of cold, and
preserve the Bodies that are covered with
them in good temperature.</p>
               <p>These are used as well in doublings of the
Mantles pertaining to Coat-Armours, as in
the Court-Armours themselves.</p>
               <p>Furrs do consist either
of One colour alone,
or,
More colours than one.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Furrs consisting of more than
one Colour, are either of Two Colours,
or,
More than two.</p>
               <p>Such Furrs as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours only, are sorted either.<list>

               <figure/>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Boswell</hi> is of this Opinion, That Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myn
and Ermyns ought never to be sorted
in Arms with the Metal of their colour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(saith he) they are but Furrs, and
have no proper Blazon with any Metal. Yet
doth he particularly Blazon the Coat of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot,
fol.</hi> 106. in the Atchievement of the Right
Honourable Lord, Sir <hi>William Cecil</hi> Knight,
late Lord Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> where he
might fitly have taken exception against such
bearing, if he could have produced any good
ground for warranting such his Opinion; in
default whereof he there passeth the same
over with silence, knowing that Antiquity
and Custome (which hath the vigour of a
Law, where there is no Law written) are
powerful in things of this nature: he secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
relinquisheth his Opinion, forasmuch as it
is manifest, that not only <hi>Walcot,</hi> but <hi>Kings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell,</hi>
and many others, both ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,
have used such bearing without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>These are other sorts of Furrs or Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
consisting also of two only Colours,
which as they are much different in form,
so do they also receive a diverse Blazon
from these before specified, which are these
that follow, and their like.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Sometimes it was permitted to men grown
to years, to use a kind of short Cloak, called
<hi>Penula,</hi> in time of wars, though it were in
substance but sleight and thin: For <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Severus</hi> the Emperour, in favour of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
men, did grant them a Priviledge for
wearing of this kind of Garments: <hi>Wolf. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius,
lib.</hi> 8. The Garments of the <hi>Tribune</hi> of
the People, and of the <hi>Plebeian</hi> Sect, were
most commonly this <hi>Penula</hi> before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
like as also was <hi>Sagum,</hi> which was a
Souldiers Cloak or Cassock, and <hi>Endromis,</hi>
which was an hairy Garment much like an
Irish Mantle and Hood. These were apt
Garments for repelling of Cold. These were
not Habits beseeming an Emperour, or chief
Commander to wear; nevertheless we read
that <hi>Caligula</hi> ware oftentimes <hi>Depictas Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulas,
Alex. lib.</hi> 5. Amongst the rest this
is to be observed, That Consuls were habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
sometimes in Coat-Armors, called <hi>Palu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damenta,</hi>
and sometimes in Kirtles called <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beae,</hi>
which was a kind of Garment worn by
Kings under their Mantles of State. So that
they were sometimes said to be <hi>Trabeati,</hi>
and sometimes to be <hi>Paludati,</hi> according to
these several Habits. Also the <hi>Lictores</hi> were
Officers that usually attended these Consuls,
and were like unto Sergeants, or Ministers
appointed to inflict corporal punishment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Offenders, and were most commonly in
number Twelve. These also attended the
Consul to the wars, invested also with Coat-Armour.</p>
               <p>Concerning those <hi>Depictae Penulae</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mentioned, they are said to have been
in use with Emperours of later Ages, that
were addicted to wantonness and delicacy,
whereof <hi>Tranquillus</hi> in <hi>Caligula,</hi> writeth in
this manner, <hi>Vestitu, calceatuque &amp; caetero
habitu, neque patrio, neque anili, ac ne vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rili
quidem, ac denique non humano semper
usus est: saepe depictas gemmatasque Penulas
indutus. Wolf. Lazius in Comment. Reip. lib.</hi>
8. 857. If you observe the proportion of this
Vaire, you shall easily discern the very shape
of the Case or Skin of little Beasts in them;
for so did ancient Governours and Princes of
the World (saith Sir <hi>Iohn. Ferne in Lac.
Nob. pag.</hi> 68.) line their pompous Robes with
Furr of divers Colours, sewing one Skin to
another, after the plainest fashion. There is
yet another kind of Furrs much differing from
all other the Furrs before expressed, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in shape, but in name also, as in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <figure/>

               </q>
               <p>So much of Furrs consisting of two Colours
only: now of such as are composed of more
than two Colours, according to the Division
before delivered.</p>
               <p>Such are these, and
their like, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <list>
                     <item>Ermynites.</item>
                     <item>Vaire of many Colours.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The other Furr that is composed of more
than two Colours, is formed of four several
Colours at the least, as in Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Although I have here in the Blazon of
this kind of Furr, as also in the Table of
this first Section put a difference between
these three words, Vaire, Verrey, and Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey,
in ascribing to every one of these a
particular property in the Blazon of Furrs
differing in Metals and Colours; in which I
must confess, I have followed <hi>Leigh;</hi> yet I
do for my own part rather agree with Sir
<hi>Iohn Ferne,</hi> who in the 86. <hi>pag.</hi> of his Book
entituled <hi>Lacy's Nobility,</hi> writeth, <hi>That there
is no other blazon allowed to a Doubling or
Furr of this nature, than only</hi> Vaire, <hi>or vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated;</hi>
for which word <hi>variated</hi> I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that our English Blazoners use <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey,</hi>
from the French Masculine participle,
<hi>vaire;</hi> and <hi>Sir Iohn Ferne</hi> there further saith,
<hi>That these differences of terms,</hi> Verrey, Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey,
<hi>and</hi> Vaire, <hi>are meer phantasies of</hi> Leigh
<hi>his Blazon, and newly by him devised, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any authority of Writers to inferr the
same: And that before</hi> Leigh <hi>his time, all
Authors had called this sort of Furr or Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
Vaire: <hi>And if it be varied, or compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of Argent and Azure, then it is so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and no Colours named: but if it consist
of any other Colour, then it is blazoned</hi> Vaire,
<hi>of such and such Colours.</hi> And I shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
in this my present Edition, always
blazon a Furr of this nature, of what Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
and Colours soever composed, yea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it consist of two Metals and two
Colours, Vaire or Verrey, always naming
the Metal and Colour, except it consisteth
of Argent and Azure: And thus concluding
the Chapter of Tinctures, being the first kind
of Accidents of Arms, I will now go on to
the second sort.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>HAving hitherto handled the first part of
the distribution before delivered touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Accidents, viz. Tincture: I
will now go forward to handle that other
member of the same, namely, Differences;
shewing first what Differences are; and so
proceed in order to the Division of them.</p>
               <p>But before I proceed to the definition and
division of them, it is not unnecessary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
That Arms may be resembled to Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical
numbers, for like as in numbers, the
addition, or subtraction of an unity, maketh
the said number to receive a diverse form
from that it hath before; in like manner by the
apposition to, or exemption of any one thing
from the Coat-Armour, be it either difference,
or whatsoever else, the Coat-Armour is not
the same, but varieth from that it was before.
This variation (occasioned by the addition or
exemption of some adventitious thing) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
altereth not the substance of the
Coat-Armour, but maketh the same to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in form only from that it was before;
for these adventitious Appositions are of the
nature of Accidents, whose property is <hi>Adesse
&amp; abesse sine subjecti corruptione;</hi> as I have
formerly shewn out of <hi>Porphyrius, p.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>Differences have no existence of themselves,
but are of the quality of Adjectives, which
need the ayd and support of some substantive,
to be annexed to them, and were devised,
for the distinguishing of Coat-Armour, of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
persons, of one and the same family
each from other among themselves, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that saying of <hi>Chass. Differentia sunt
quaedam aceidentia per se non existentia, quae
inducunt diversitatem separativam, per quam
dignoscuntur talia Arma, in quibus sunt inserta,
ab armis alterius.</hi> But I will proceed to the
definition and division of Differences.</p>
               <p>Differences are extraordinary additaments,
whereby Bearers of the same Coat-Armour
are distinguished each from other, and their
nearness to the principal Bearer is Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>
               <p>Of Differences some are <list>
                     <item>Ancient,</item>
                     <item>Modern.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Those I call ancient Differences, that
were used in ancient time for the distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
not only of one Nation or Tribe from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
but also to note a diversity between
particular persons, descended out of one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and from the same Parents. Such are
Bordures and Imborduring of all sorts. The
Bordures that were annexed unto Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
in the beginning were plain, and (in
all likelyhood) were of some one of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
or Meals before spoken of: But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in process of time (by reason of the
multiplication of Persons and of Families)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55096:16"/>
men were constrained to devise other sorts
of Bordures, to induce a variety, whereby
each particular person might be distinctly
known, and differenced <hi>ab omnibus &amp; singulis
ejusdem domus &amp; familiae.</hi> Of these there
are divers forms, as by these examples follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may appear.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The plain Bordure, used for differing of Coat-Armour,
is resembled to those Fimbria's, or
Bordures, that Almighty God, by the mouth
of his Servant <hi>Moses,</hi> commanded the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
to wear about the skirts of their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to put them in mind of their duties
touching their observation of his Precepts;
In respect that the people were yet rude,
and unexercised in obedience, therefore was
this Ordinance prescribed unto them; as St.
<hi>Hierom</hi> noteth in these words: <hi>Rudi adhuc
populo, &amp; hominibus ad obedientiam insuetis,
per Moysen imperatur à Domino: ut in sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
memoriae quod praecepta Domini recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentur,
per singulas vestimentorum fimbrias
habeant cum cocco Hyacinthini coloris Insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
ut etiam casu huc illucque respicienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
oculis, mandatorum Coelestium memoria
nascatur.</hi> Of these Bordures were the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees
reproved by Christ, because they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the use thereof, by wearing them,
not for the putting of them in mind of the
observation of Gods Precepts, but for a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and their own vain ostentation, and to
the end they would seem more strict and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
observers of Gods Precepts, than others
were.</p>
               <p>The Content of the Bordures (saith <hi>Leigh</hi>)
is the fifth part of the Field. Also it is to be
observed, that when the Field and the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
or Tract about the same, drawn (as
in this example) be both of one Metal, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
or Furr, then shall you not term it a
Bordure, but you shall say, that he beareth
such Metal, Colour or Furr imbordured.
<hi>Leigh</hi> reckoneth this sort of imborduring
here spoken of, to be of the number of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
of Brethren; but <hi>Bartol</hi> (saith he)
hath committed the distribution thereof to the
Heraulds.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed to the Compound Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures
above specified, I will give some few
Examples of other several forms of simple
Bordures; (<hi>Quia simplicia priora fuerunt
compositis</hi>) as followeth.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The next sort of Bordure that I will note
unto you, is a Bordure invecked; and the same
is formed as appeareth in this next Escocheon.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <l>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:55096:16"/>Sir <hi>Perducas Dalbreth</hi> to the French return'd,</l>
               <l>Who Guly Shield about his neck did fling,</l>
               <l>Wrapt with dent Bordure silver shining.</l>
               <p>This Bordure is said to be indented, because
it seemeth to be composed (as it were) of
Teeth, whereof the same hath a resemblance
as well in property as in form: For Teeth
(especially those of Beasts of ravenous kind,
or of prey) have that part of their Teeth
next to their Gums, broad and strong, and
their points sharp, after the manner above
specified; and they are called in Latin, <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
a demendo</hi> (as <hi>Isidorus</hi> noteth) which
signifieth to take away or diminish, <hi>Quia a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquid
de cibis semper demunt.</hi> In the same
manner also do every of these Indentings,
entring into the Field, lessen and take away
some part of them as they go.</p>
               <p>Note that all sorts of Bordures are subject
to charging with things, as well Artificial,
as Natural; as by examples following, in
part shall appear; wherein I purpose not to
be curious, either in their number, or yet in
their order; but as they shall come to
hand, so will I set them down in their proper
places.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of Bordures simple. Now of such
as are compounded, as followeth:</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>Sometimes you shall find the Bordures
charged with things living, as in these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>A like Bordure doth <hi>Iasper</hi> Earl of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke</hi>
bear, that was half-brother to King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, and was created Duke of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55096:17"/>
                  <hi>Bedford,</hi> by that most prudent Prince, King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Sometimes you shall find two of these sorts
of Bordures before handled, commixt in one,
as in these next Examples following.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>Otherwhiles you shall have Bordures charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with other sorts of things <hi>inanimate,</hi> or
without life, as in this next example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Sometimes you shall find Bordures gobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
of two Colours, as in this next Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>As this Bordure is gobonated, so shall you
find Bordures, either Bendy, or Bendwaies, or
charged with Bends, as in this next Escocheon
in part may appear.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>There resteth yet one Example more of
Bordurings, which I have here placed, to
the end the same may serve in stead of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
particular demonstrations, otherwise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
for the full understanding of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
several sorts of Diapering that may be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in Bordures, as in Example;</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>This kind of bearing Diaper in Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
is sometimes seen in Coats of <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>Belgia,</hi> but very rare or never in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne</hi> noteth. <hi>Diaper</hi>
(saith he) <hi>is known of every man to be a
fantastical work of knots, within which are
wrought the signs or forms of things, either
quick or dead, according to the invention of
the Work-master, as is well known in</hi> Ipres,
Bruges, <hi>and some Cities of</hi> Heynault. In the
blazon of such Coats you must first name the
Colour or Metal of the Field.</p>
               <p>As touching their first several Charges impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon these Bordures aforehandled, I should
not (I acknowledge) have made mention of
them at all in this place (the order of my
Method respected) <hi>sed propter necessitatem
nonnunquam recedendum est à regulis.</hi> But
the occasion offered to treat of the differences
of Bordures in this place, enforced me to make
untimely mention of those Charges, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
I might yield some satisfaction to the
Reader touching these variable forms, which
I could no way better perform than by demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative
Examples: <hi>Exempla enim ponimus, ut
sentiant addiscentes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, that I take here only
mentioned a Bordure and Imborduring, for
ancient Differences, yet I do not thereupon
conclude, that Antiquity was not acquainted
with any other than these: but the Reason,
that I do not particularly here discourse at
large of those other ancient Differences, is,
because the use of divers of them now, as
Differences, is antiquated; and some of them
are now used, as Ordinaries, or some other
Charge of the Field, which I shall afterward
handle, but not here, because it sutes not
with my intended Method; others of those
ancient ones are still in use, as Differences, but
to demonstrate some other younger Brother
than anciently they did, and therefore now
termed modern, by changing of their first
use. Let it therefore suffice only to name
some of those first sort here mentioned, as
Orles, Cotizes, Bends, &amp;c. Which how they
then were disposed of, in the Terminal, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral,
and Fixal Coat-Armours, I refer you
to Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne</hi> and others, who have writ
plentifully of them. In those elder times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
the variation of Metal or Colour, Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of Charge, yea, sometime change
of the Charge, or of part of the Charge, were
used for distinctions of Families, as you may
observe in divers Authors, and in the Coat-Armours
of younger branches of many ancient
Families.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <p>HItherto of the ancient manner of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing
Coat-Armours: Next, such as
we call modern Differences, come in
order to be handled. I call those modern
Differences that are of a latter institution, and
put in use sithence the invention of Bordures.
Such are these that follow, and their like,
viz. the File, Crescent, Mullet, Martlet, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulet,
Flower de lis, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>What these Files are, I cannot certainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch, because I find that divers Authors,
and those very Judicial in matters of this
kind, do diversly judge of them, according to
their several conceits. <hi>Vpton,</hi> a man much
commended for his skill in blazon, and of
some Armorists supposed to have been the
first that made observation of their use (but
they are therein much deceived, for that
such use was made of them many Ages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Vptons</hi> time) calleth them Points, such
as men usually fasten their Garments withal,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55096:18"/>
and saith, they may be born either even or
odd, to the number of Nine. <hi>Budaeus,</hi> an
ancient Writer, affirmeth them to be Tongs,
and that they may be born but odd. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatus</hi>
in his <hi>Parergon</hi> nameth them Plaitez
or Plaits of Garments. <hi>Bartolus</hi> calleth them
Candles. Some other <hi>Authors</hi> call them Files,
and others Lambeaux or Labels. In this so
great uncertainty, I forbear to determine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, seeing those so Learned cannot
certainly resolve among themselves what they
are. Only concerning their divers manner
of bearing, these Examples following will
give light: wherein I will begin with their
single bearing, and so I will proceed to their
Compound use.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vpton</hi> saith, that Files are not born for
Arms, but for differences of Arms: <hi>Tales
lingulae sive labellae</hi> (saith he) <hi>non dicuntur
proprie signa, sed differentiae signorum.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
in practise it falls out otherwise,
as in this Coat here expressed, and others
following may be seen. For we find that
Labels are born both single and manifold,
without any other manner of Charge; so
that it is clear that they are born sometimes
for Arms, and not always for differences of
Arms, as by the second Escocheon following
more plainly appeareth.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>Note, That as the Bordures before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
so also these Files are oftentimes
charged with things, as well quick as dead,
whereof I will give you some few Examples in
these next Escocheons.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Label of the Heir apparent</hi> (saith
<hi>Wyrly</hi>) <hi>is seldom transferred unto the second
Brother, but when the Inheritance goeth to
the Daughters of the eldest Brother.</hi> In
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55096:18"/>
which case, it was permitted unto him, to
bear the File as Heir-male of his Family,
and as one that remained in expectancy of
the Inheritance, if the Issue of his Neeces
should fail. Note, that the second Brother
might not intrude himself into the absolute
Signs of his Family, the Inheritance being
in his Neeces or Kinswomen. <hi>Hugh de Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings</hi>
being a second Brother, and his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
did bear a Label for their difference up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the like occasion, and for the reasons here
mentioned.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>Forasmuch as it hath been anciently que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned
(and for ought that I could ever see,
resteth as yet undecided) by <hi>Bartholus, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus,</hi>
and other Judicious persons of their
times, Whether Files or Labels should be born
with even points, or odd? some holding that
they could not be born but odd, others
maintaining they might be used indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as well even as odd. In my former Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
I followed the stronger Opinion, and
in all the precedent Examples have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
patterns of unequal points. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
not so resting satisfied, I have sithence
endeavoured to examine their use (the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest
Interpreter of things doubtful) to which
end I took occasion to peruse certain Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellanean
notes of Seals, which I had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
long ago: by which Seales it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they had been anciently used to be born
as well even as odd; whereupon (out of my
desire to clear all doubts, and to make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing as perspicuous and manifold as I
could) I resolved to cut such Seals as came
to my hands, for the better approbation of
this my assertion, and content of the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and withal to set them down according to
order of even bearing, <hi>viz.</hi> two, four, six, &amp;c.
before I would conclude this Chapter of Files.
As in Example:</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>This piece of Evidence resteth amongst the
Writings or Deeds of <hi>George Thorpe</hi> of

Gentlemen Pensioners, whose residence

               </p>

               <figure/>
               <p>This Coat might have been more aptly
placed hereafter in the second Section, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Ordinaries of divers kinds, born one
upon another; but that I desire to place all
my Labels of even points together without
interruption, though I digressed somewhat
therein by giving way to necessity, albeit
with breach of Rule and Order; <hi>Nonnun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
enim propter excellentiam seu neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitatem
receditur à Regulis.</hi> This form of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55096:19"/>
bearing of Files with four points, is also
warranted by Rolls of great Antiquity; as
appeareth by the Coat of Sir <hi>Thomas Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne,</hi>
that bare Azure, six Lionceaux Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant,
Or, a File of four points, Gules, which
I do here pass over, as well for brevity,
as for impertinency thereof to this place, in
respect of the Lions, the principal charge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Note here a strange bearing of a File.</p>

               <p>This Example serveth to confirm my form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
assertion, That Files are not only born
for differences, but sometimes for the only
charge of the Coat-Armour, as appeareth by
the Coat of <hi>Henlington,</hi> whereof I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Example elsewhere: And herein we may
observe a rare form of position thereof in bend
Sinister.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>For the shunning of multiplicity of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
I will give an instance of a Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
comprehending both sorts of Files, <hi>viz.</hi>
even and odd points, which for that it is sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and unmixt with any ordinary or common
Charge, may serve in stead of all: As in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Now if any man will demand of me, why
I do spend my oyl and travel in things of
so small moment? To such I answer, that so
long as I travel to find out the truth, I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
my travel well bestowed, though the
matter be of never so small importance,
<hi>Suave enim est in minimis etiam vera scire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is yet another form of bearing of
Files, diverse from these before mentioned,
which albeit the same be not in use with us,
but seemeth to be a National Custome peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
to the Kingdom of <hi>France:</hi> Nevertheless,
sithence I have undertaken to treat amongst
things of the use of blazoning of Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
I would not willingly omit any form of
bearing, or other remarkable thing, that
might make either my self or the Reader
more expert in the use of Blazon. This form
of bearing Files, which I will now shew you,
is not distant some little space from the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
part of the Chief (after the most usual fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
but groweth immediately out of the
Chief it self.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>In like sort divers other Noble Houses of
<hi>France, viz.</hi> of <hi>Valois,</hi> of <hi>Berry,</hi> and of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencon,</hi>
have Bordures either plain or engrail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or charged with Besants, those of <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reux</hi>
Bastons, Or, and Argent, and they of
<hi>Bourbon</hi> Bastons, Gules.</p>
               <p>Here may rise a Question not unworthy our
observation, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether like as the eldest
Brother is preferred before the second, so
the Son of the Eldest Brother shall in like
sort be preferred, or take place before his
Uncle? And this hath been holden a great
and difficult Question a long season; until at
length, <hi>Otho</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>Trevere</hi> with his Barons, this matter
was there questioned, he ordained that the
cause should be decided by Combat, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Nephew hardly obtained the Victory;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55096:19"/>
because it was deemed to have proceeded by
the secret Judgment of God, it was decreed
that from thenceforth the Nephew should be
preferred before the Uncle. Of this mind
are <hi>Nich. Boerius, Lucas de Penna,</hi> and <hi>Iohn
de Montolero,</hi> that the Nephew should take
place.</p>
               <p>The like Question hath risen in <hi>France</hi>
between the Second Daughter, and the Son
of the Eldest Sister, as well in <hi>Avignon,</hi> a
City of <hi>Narbone</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> as in other parts
thereof, which remained long undetermined.
At length it was finally adjudged in the Court
of Parliament (holden at <hi>Paris</hi>) for the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews,
for whom also it was likewise decreed
in the City of <hi>Avignon.</hi>

               <p>If any man shall demand of me, How it
cometh to pass that the Diminutions or Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
of Arms beforementioned, are so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly
born, not only in forraign Countries,
but also in one self Nation? Or why there
is not one set form observed in the use of
them with all Nations? I answer, That it is
not possible, because of the infinite actions of
men, which are no less infinitely subject to
mutability, and therefore can by no means
be reduced to a Set-form of bearing universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
according to that saying of an uncertain
Author, <hi>Res sunt infinitae, infiniteque muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles,
idcircò praecepto generali comprehendi
non possunt.</hi>

               <p>It hath been evermore one Observation
with Nations in bearing of Arms, that as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
particular Family (saith Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne</hi>)
did bear Arms, different in substance from
those of other Families, so those that are
descended of the self same Bloud, should like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
bear the Arms of that House and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
whereof they are descended, in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
manner each from other (not in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
but in Accidents) for the distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Line of Agnation. And the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of these Differences, albeit they seem
to make some alteration in the Coat-Armours
whereunto they are annexed, yet is the same
but meerly Accidental, the Substance still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
as it was before; the Nature of these
Appositions being such as is of all other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
<hi>Vt possint abesse, &amp; adesse sine sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecti
interitu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And these Differences annexed to Coat-Armours
are of some Authors termed (and
that not improperly) <hi>Diminutiones Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
in respect they do derogate from the
Dignity of the Arms whereto they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as expresly manifesting them to be of
less esteem than those from which they are
derived: <hi>Multiplicitas enim individuorum,
in eadem specie diminutionem arguit.</hi> But
doubtless, the conceit of Apposition of these
Differences to Coat-Armours was grounded
upon the necessity (the common Parent of
all Inventions) as well that thereby all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
bearing of Arms might be avoided; as
also that the Prerogative of the Eldest Son
should be preserved inviolable. And for this
cause hath the Eldest of every Noble and
Generous Family, his peculiar manner of sole
and plain bearing, which he will in no case
permit any other man to use, though he be
of the same Family and Surname, but with
addition of some kind of Difference, because
the sole bearing of Arms pertaineth only to
the first begotten: <hi>In primogenito enim</hi> (saith
<hi>Lyra) tanquam in capite stat, &amp; remanet splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
geniturae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As touching the Dignity of the Firstbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
<hi>Tremellius</hi> in his <hi>Annotations</hi> upon
the 49th of <hi>Genesis,</hi> maketh mention of two
chief Prerogatives due unto <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ben,</hi> had he
not defiled his Fathers Bed; the one of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
whereby he had his Brethren in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
unto him; the other of Strength, by
reason of his double portion of Inheritance.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Chassanaeus</hi> saith, <hi>Ea quae acquiruntur
Primogenito, acquiruntur titulo universali,
item acquiruntur ut constituto in dignitate.</hi>
For these respects the Arms of the Family
ought to remain entire to the Eldest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the second, third, and fourth begotten
Sons cannot arrogate to themselves any such
Prerogative, and therefore may not bear their
Coat but with Difference.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, these Differences here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, are of some Authors called <hi>Doctrinae
Armorum;</hi> and that very aptly, in regard
that by the apposition of them to Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
our understanding (upon sight of them)
is informed from what Line of Consanguini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
the Bearer of such Difference doth abstract
himself, whether from the Line Ascending,
Descending, or Collateral; as also in what
Degree he standeth; as, whether he be the
second, third, or fourth begotten Child of such
a Parent. And such apposition in no less
lawful, than is the addition of Names of
Baptisme unto the Surname of the Family:
<hi>Sicut enim nomina inventa sunt ad cognoscen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos
homines, ita arma vel insignia ad fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milias
&amp; personas distinguendas singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is yet a further use of these Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
in that they serve to prevent and
avoid Dissentions, Debates, Challenges, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats,
and Slaughters. For as to all Brethren
there is but one Surname allowed; yet for
Difference, that one of them may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
from another, there is added unto
each Brother a <hi>Praenomen,</hi> or Name of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism;
so is it necessary, that since the Coat-Armour
of the Ancestor is competible to all
the Children (as the Mark of the Family
whereof they are descended, that a Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
should be added to the Coat-Armour
of every Brother, to mark and limit out to
all mens sight the diversity of their Birth
and Line whereupon they depend, that so
all occasion of Challenge may be prevented,
when each man knoweth not only his place
of precedence, but also his nearness and place
of title to the Inheritance.</p>
               <p>Whereas I have formerly, among the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of Bordures, used demonstrations of
Differences in the Blood Royal, of some of
the younger Sons of Kings, I hold it fit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I conclude this Tract of Differences, to
give a little touch of the necessity why these
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55096:20"/>
should be more eminent than those of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
use, with Persons of inferiour Estate.
First, in regard that if the Coat-Armour of
others should have too near a conformity
and resemblance with the Soveraign Ensigns,
the Vulgar sort perhaps might (in some cases
or pretences) be seduced to follow such a one
as were not their King, to the great distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of the State, and no less peril to the
Person of their lawful Soveraign. And not
only is it so in Coats pertaining to the Blood
Royal, but also in other inferiour Callings:
For in ancient time (saith <hi>Wyrly</hi>) when men
could not sufficiently distinguish their Coat-Armours
by changing their Devices into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Colours, for the Number of Leaders,
that many times were of one House or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
then were they forced to very their
Marks by the said Additions. And very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
should you see in those times, Cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,
Mollets, of such small things born for
a Difference: or if any such were, they were
made so large; that they might easily be
discerned by the distance of forty foot. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
the Soveraign Estate and Dignity
being compared with the quality of any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
the Difference will be found so great
between them, and the one so far surmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the other of them, as that Reason it self
willeth that so great a Difference should be
put between the Royal Ensigns and the Arms
of a Subject, as there is between their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
and Degrees, since those Ensigns are
the Marks of their worthiness and esteem.</p>
               <p>For these and other respects, it hath been,
and yet still is in use, that in Addition of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
to the Arms of Kings younger Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
the skilful Heralds have given some of
the Honourable Ordinaries, for more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Distinctions, as a Fess, Chief, Bend,
Pile, Bordure, and such like, as we may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
see in divers ancient Coats born by
such Noble Personages as have descended
from the Collateral Lines of the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
France, Scotland, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning those Modern Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
expressed in the form of Six Ranks, <hi>p. 25.
viz.</hi> Crescents, Mollets, Martlets, &amp;c. not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their institution was ingenious,
yet hath tract of time discovered their use
to be dangerous, especially in Martial Affairs,
by reason of their darkness and unapparent
forms, occasioned by imposition of one Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
upon another; the peril whereof hath
not a little extenuated their estimation. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
their invention is not therefore to
be condemned, inasmuch as the Events have
not fallen out answerable to the intention of
their first Deviser: Neither can it be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
justly said to be done without ground
of Reason, as a certain Author noteth: <hi>Si fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </p>
               <p>Here it is to be observed, that Differences
do in no ways appertain unto Sisters, for
that they are reputed to be separated and
divided from the Family whereof they are
descended, inasmuch as when they are once
married, they do lose their own Surname,
and do receive their denomination from the
Family whereof their Husbands are descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And so much doth the word <hi>Soror</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
unto us, as <hi>Sosinus</hi> saith: <hi>Soror est quasi
seorsim nata, &amp; à familia separata.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To Daughters it is permitted to bear the
Arms of their Father, even as the Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth after his Fathers decease, without
any scandal or challenge of their Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for that to Daughters never were any
Differences allowed, and that for three cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
First, Because their Coats are never, or
very seldom advanced in the Field, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as to that Sex War is reputed odious.
Secondly, For that the Coat-Armour is no
longer born by them than during their life,
for the same extendeth not to their Issue.
Lastly, Because so long as Issue continueth
of any of the Brethrens Lines, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred
from the Inheritance. Yet in some
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ases they shall bear the Coat-Armour to
them and their Heirs; as in Example, If all
the Issue of the Brethren happen to become
extinct, then the Daughters shall Inherit the
Land of their Ancestor? In which case, they
may therewithal assume his Coat-Armour,
and bear the same by themselves and their
Heirs for ever. But betwixt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the Reason whereof is, for that since
by them the Name of the House cannot be
preserved; therefore they are admitted to
the Inheritance equally: and are adjudged
but one Heir to all intents and purposes,
in Laws as well Martial as Civil, without
any eminent Prerogative either of Honour

               <p>An Escocheon is the form or representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Shield of what kind soever, and is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55096:21"/>
so called of the Latin word <hi>Scutum;</hi> which
hath the same signification: whence also an
Esquire, or Page, takes his name of <hi>Scutiger,</hi>
signifying primarily a Target-bearer. And
the Target is not unaptly deduced from the
Latin word <hi>Tergus,</hi> a Beasts hide, whereof at
first Shields were made: whereupon <hi>Pliny</hi>
saith, <hi>Tergus ad scuta galeasque impeuetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi>
An impenetrable hide fit to make a Shield.

conceived and understood, I will particularize
these as I have done the former, beginning
with the Middle Point.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The knowledge of these Points is very
requisite, in respect, that when divers of
these Points are occupied with sundry things
of different kinds (as oftentimes it falleth
out in some Escocheons) you may be able
thereby to assign unto each Point his apt and
peculiar Name, according to the Dignity of
his place. For no man can perfectly Blazon
any such Coat, unless he doth rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the particular Points of the Escocheon.</p>

               <p>WE come now from Points, the first
part in our partition of Accidents
of an Escocheon, to the second part,
which is Abatements.</p>
               <p>An Abatement is an accidental Mark an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to Coat-Armour, denoting some ungen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman-like,
dishonourable, or disloyal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour,
quality, or stain in the Bearer,
whereby the Dignity of the Coat-Armour is
greatly abased.</p>
               <p>Abatements do consist in <list>
                     <item>Diminution.</item>
                     <item>Reversing.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Diminution is a blemishing or defacing of
some particular Point or Points of the Esco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon,
by reason of the imposition of some
stain and Colour thereupon. Note, that all
these Marks of Diminution, in the Escoche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
next following, must be evermore of
some one of the stainand Colours, viz. Taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
or Murrey, and must in no wise be of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
neither must they be charged in any
case, for so should they be Additions of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p>These are placed on
 <list>
                     <item>The Midle.</item>

               </p>
               <p>Such as are placed in the Middle are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in these next two Escocheons follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whereof the first is a Delf, as in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>Such Diminutions as are placed upon some
other part of the Escocheon.</p>
               <p>Do occupy <list>
                     <item>One point alone.</item>

               </p>
               <p>That which occupieth one alone, is called a
Dexter point parted, an Example whereof you
may see in this next Escocheon.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Such <hi>Diminutions</hi> as do occupy more than
one point of the Escocheon.</p>
               <p>Do comprehend <list>

                     <item>Less than four.</item>

               </p>
               <p>That Diminution of the former sort, is this
which you see in this Escocheon, and is due to
him that is sloathful in the Wars.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Those Diminutions that do comprehend
fewer than four.</p>
               <p>Are either of

               </p>
               <p>Such are said to comprehend three Points,
whose Lines do bound so many within their
Limits, as in Example.</p>

                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:55096:22"/>He beareth Or, Point Champain,
Tenn. This
is the first of those Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutions,
that do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
three Points,
and is formed of one
Arch-line, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
his beginning
from the Dexter Base
(and including the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemost)
and endeth in the Sinister Base
Point. This is due unto him that killeth his
Prisoner (humbly submitting himself) with
his own hands, though in extreme need it
is allowed by the Law of Arms, rather to
kill, than to hazzard himself to be slain.
<hi>Always</hi> (saith Sir <hi>Iohn Froysard</hi>) <hi>by right of
Arms a man ought to grieve his Enemy,
and good company of Arms is mercy to Knights
and Souldiers.</hi>

               <figure/>
               <p>That Abatement that comprehendeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
two Points of the Escocheon, is called a
Gusset, and is formed of a Traverse Line,
drawn either from the Dexter or Sinister
Chief Point of the Escocheon tending to the
Honour Point, and descending from thence
perpendicularly to the extream base parts of
the Escocheon; as in this next Example ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
wherein are expressed both the Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Sinister Goars.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Hitherto of such Abatements as do abase
the estimation of the Coat-Armour whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
they are annexed, in some parts or points
of them only, being the first sort of Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
whereof we promised to speak.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the last and worst of all the
rest, which is a Coat-Armour reversed. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
is a preposterous manner of location
of a Coat-Armour, by turning of the whole
Escocheon upside down, contrary to the usual
form of bearing, after this manner.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>As touching persons convicted of High
Treason in the Justice of the Law of Arms,
for the further coercion of so heinous a Fact as
Treason is, and for a further punishment both
of the Traytor and of his whole Progeny; it
is to be observed, that if a Gentleman of Coat-Armour
hath Issue divers Sons, and committeth
Treason, he hath forfeited his Coat-Armour
for ever, neither may his Issue bear the same,
<hi>Quia eorum memoria destrui debet:</hi> For that
the memory of them may utterly be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.
For since it is held they may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
killed, seeing they are said to be Enemies
to the King and People, much more is it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to prohibit to their Heirs, together with
the Inheritance. their Arms also, and stile of
Gentry: Insomuch, as some are of Opinion,
that the Son loseth <hi>Iura Sepulchrorum,</hi> the
Rights and Ceremonies of Burial accustomed
to Gentry. And of <hi>Marcus Manlius</hi> (who
was condemned of Treason against the <hi>Roman</hi>
State) we find a Law that none should ever
bear that name. A notable Example whereof
we saw of late on the Instrument of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villish
Parricide on the late puissant King of
<hi>France,</hi> for the obliterating of the Name and
Memory of such a Villain out of that Kingdom.
And in <hi>Ireland,</hi> such Traytors as are convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by the Acts and Ordinances of the High
Court of Parliament, are by force thereof ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
to suffer damage in their Name, State,
Preheminence, Dignities and Honour to them
due in fore-passed times. As in all their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Lordships, Castles, Mannors, and in all
their Hereditaments whatsoever: Moreover,
that they shall sustain corruption of their Blood
and Family, and both himself and his Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
are (by force of such Conviction and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
disabled to demand, receive or recover of
any man by descent from any of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
either Lineal, or Collateral; neither are
the Children of persons so convicted, permitted
to make their Pedegree, or to derive themselves
from such Parents.</p>
               <p>Finally, if such an one were invested with
any honourable Dignity, the Laws adjudge
not only his Coat-Armour to be razed, and his
Shield reversed, but also his Spear truncked,
his Spurrs hewen from his Heels, his Horse
docked, his Sword to be broken upon his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,
his Crest divided, his Statues pulled down,
his Blood corrupted, and his Body to death (<hi>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si
speciali Regis rescripto intervenerit gratia,</hi>
without the Kings special pardon) his Family
at an end, his Possessions taken away and (for
a greater terrour) given to some other Family,
whose profitable Service to the King and State
may better deserve it. So loathsome is this
Offence to Nobility, that she cannot suffer the
Marks of him that hath offended in so high a
degree, to possess any place with her Ensigns;
but that the same shall be without all reverence
defaced, and spurned into some base place: So
that by such his Degradation, he receiveth far
greater shame and ignominy, than ever he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Honour by his Advancement, according
to the old Proverb, <q>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving formerly handled,
in the first Section, the
Common Accidents of an
Escocheon, <hi>viz.</hi> Points
and Abatements: Now
will I proceed to shew
their several kinds.</p>
               <p>Escocheons are either of
 <list>
                     <item>One Tincture.</item>
                     <item>More than one.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Those Escocheons are said to be of one
Tincture, that have only some one Metal,
Colour, or Furr, appearing in the Shield of
any Nobleman or Gentleman. Concerning
this form of bearing, it hath been holden of
some Writers a matter doubtful, whether one
Metal, Colour, or Furr born alone in a Shield
be ancient or honourable: Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
such bearing to be false Arms, and not
worth the receiving, except in some special
cases; being perhaps thereunto induced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was reckoned among the <hi>Romans</hi> a
thing reproachful to bear a naked Shield with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Portraiture, in regard it was an usual
thing with men of Valour and Courage to have
their Shields painted.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Contrariwise, <hi>Leigh</hi> reckoneth such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portraited
bearing to be good, and withal ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ancient, grounding his Assertion (if I be
not deceived) upon 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 16. where
it is said that King <hi>Solomon</hi> made Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Targets of beaten Gold, and that Six
hundred Sheckles of Gold went to a Target;
as also that he made Three hundred Shields
of beaten Gold, and that Three pound of Gold
went to one Shield.</p>
               <p>Also we read, that <hi>Simon,</hi> the High Priest
of the Jews, sent <hi>Numenius</hi> with a Shield of
great value to the <hi>Roman</hi> State, to confirm
the League of Friendship between them, as
appeareth in 1 <hi>Macchab.</hi> 14. 24. in these words,
<hi>After this,</hi> Simon <hi>sent Numenius to</hi> Rome,
<hi>with a great Shield of Gold of a thousand
pound weight, to confirm the friendship with
them.</hi> And in the Letter of <hi>Lucius</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,
mention is again made of the Thousand
pound weight of this Golden Shield, 1 <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab.</hi>
15. 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Furthermore, we read that <hi>Alexander Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi>
the Emperour, had certain Golden
Shields, whose Bearers were named <hi>Chrysoas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides,</hi>
the Golden Shield-Bearers. And as
touching the Bearers of Shields made of clean
Silver, we read that <hi>Alexander Macedo</hi> had
such, whose Bearers were named <hi>Argyraspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
Silver Shield-bearers, which manner of
bearing (saith <hi>Alex. ab Alex.</hi> they borrowed
of the <hi>Samnites.</hi> Neither is there any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that these were garnished with any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bossments,
Graving, or Portraitures.</p>
               <p>Now to prove, that not only Metals, but
Colours also, have been anciently born alone
in Shields, I will note unto you the words of
the Prophet <hi>Nahum, Chap.</hi> 2. where it is said,
<hi>Clypeus potentum ejus rubricatus, bellatores
coccinati, &amp;c. The Shields of the Mighty ones
were red, &amp;c.</hi> alluding to their bloody
Fights.</p>
               <p>We also find that the <hi>Grecians</hi> used Russet
Shields. The People of <hi>Lucania</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
between <hi>Calabria</hi> and <hi>Apulia,</hi> had their
Shields wrought of <hi>Osiers,</hi> or Twigs, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
over with Leather. It was the manner
of the <hi>Scythians, Medes,</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> to have
their Shields of Red Colour, to the end that
the effusion of their blood should not easily be
discovered (when they received any wound)
either to the discouragement of themselves,
or animating of their Enemies. Moreover,
these Nations used Scarlet and Red Colours in
their Military Garments and Shields, to the
end they might thereby strike the greater ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and astonishment into the hearts of their
Enemies.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>Yet will I note unto you one Coat-Armour
consisting of Furrs, for the beauty and rarity
thereof, and the same of no Vulgar bearing,
as you may see in this next Escocheon.</p>

               <p>FRom Shields or Escocheons consisting of
one Tincture only, we come to such as
have more Tinctures than one. Such
Escocheon is that, wherein divers Colours are
represented to our sight.</p>
               <p>Of this some have Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture <list>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Tincture is said to predominate, when some
one Metal, Colour, or Furr is spread, or (at
least) understood to be spread all over the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
or Surface of the Escocheon, which
we usually call the Field thereof. In such E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scocheons
as have in them more Tinctures
than one (as is usual with the greatest number
of them)</p>
               <p>We must observe the

               </p>
               <p>The Field is the whole Surface (if I may so
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55096:25"/>
call it) of the Shield overspread with some
Metal, Colour, or Furr, and comprehendeth
in it the Charge, if it hath any. Look how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
many Metals, Colours and Furrs there are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed,
so many several Fields of Arms
there be. In Blazoning of any Arms, you
must (according to the Rule given, <hi>pag.</hi> 9.)
first express the Metal, Colour, or Furr of the
Field, saying, He beareth Or, Argent, Gules,
&amp;c. or thus, The Field is Or, Argent, Gules,
&amp;c. but you must not name this word Field,
when you use these words, He beareth; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
He beareth a Field, Or, Argent, Gules,
&amp;c. but you shall only name the Metal, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
or Furr; thus, The Field is Or, Argent,
Gules, &amp;c. or, He beareth Or, Argent, Gules,
&amp;c. and then proceed to the Blazon of the
Charge, if there be any. The first Metal,
Colour, or Furr that you begin to Blazon
withal, is always understood among our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Blazoners to be the Field. Also in Blazon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Arms composed of Field and Charge,
if there be several Charges, whereof the one
lieth nearer to the Field than the other, after
you have nominated the Metal, Colour, or
Furr of the Field, then must you proceed to
the immediate Charge that lieth next to the
Field, and after to that which is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote.</p>
               <p>Whereas I have formerly made mention
of Tinctures or Colours; when I speak of
the Tinctures or Colours of Fields, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
thereby, those special Colours before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named,
which as by a certain peculiar Right
belong to the Art Armorial; utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
all those that are named general or
proper Colours, as altogether unfit for Fields of
Coat-Armours.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>THese Fields are the parts of Arms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining:
Charges, which are the parts
contained, are next to be considered.
A Charge, is that thing whatsoever that
doth occupy the Field, and is in the same as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentum
in Continente,</hi> whether it be Sensitive
or Vegetable, Natural or Artificial, and is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
either throughout all the Superficies of
the Escocheon, or else in some special part of
the same.</p>
               <p>The Common Accidents of Charges
Are<list>
                     <item>Adumbration, or Transparency.</item>
                     <item>Transmutation, or Counter-changing.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Adumbration or Transparency is a clear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption
of the Substance of the Charge or
thing born, in such sort, as that there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
nothing thereof to be discerned, but the
naked and bare proportion of the outward li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments
thereof, or the outward Tract,
Purfle, or Shadow of a thing; and such kind
of Bearing is, by better Heralds than Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians,
termed Transparent, <hi>quasi transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,</hi>
because the Field, being (as it were)
on the further side of the Charge, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the same, yet the Tincture and Colour
thereof sheweth clean through the Charge,
and that no less clearly than as if it were
through a Glass.</p>
               <p>In Blazoning of Coat-Armour of this kind,
you shall say that the Owner thereof beareth
this Beast, Bird, Tree, &amp;c. umbrated; for that
by reason of the exemption of the Substance
thereof, which was intended to be the Charge,
it affordeth no other representation than the
simple Shadow thereof, which in Latin is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Vmbra,</hi> and thereof is it termed umbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And the portraying out of any thing
umbrated, is nothing else but a sleight and
single draught or Purfle, traced out with a
Pencil, expressing to the view a vacant form
of a thing deprived of all Substance, which
must be done with some imperfect or obscure
Colour, as Black or Tawny, unless the Field be
of the same Colour.</p>
               <p>Such Bearing hath undergone the sharp Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of those that judged it to have been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
by reason of some ungentleman-like,
or unthrifty quality, in regard that the same
representeth a Shadow void of Substance. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are of Opinion, that their Owners were
such, whose Progenitors in fore-passed times
have born the same essentially and compleatly
according to the true use of Bearing: But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as their Patrimony and Possessions
were much impaired, or utterly wasted; their
Nephews and Kinsmen seeing themselves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of their Inheritance, and yet living in
hope, that in future time the same may (by
some unexpected Accident) revert unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or to their Posterities (laying aside all
ordinary differences) chuse rather to bear
their Arms umbrated, that whensoever either
that Inheritance, or any other high Fortunes
should light on their Family, they might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again
resume the wonted Substance to such
their umbrated form, and so reduce their
Arms to their ancient Bearing. And it is
deemed a far better course (upon such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)
to bear the Arms of their Progenitors,
umbrated, than utterly to reject the same,
whereby it might (within a few Descents)
be doubted much, if not denied, that they
were descended from such a Family.</p>
               <p>Whatsoever is born with Arms umbrated,
must not be charged in any case. In Blazon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you must never nominate the Colour of
such Tract of the thing that is umbrated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they do only bear a shew of that
they are not, that is to say, of a Charge;
and therefore is the Colour of such Adumbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
esteemed unworthy to be named in Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55096:26"/>
As touching the distribution of Charges,
it is to be observed, that</p>
               <p>All Charges of Arms are either
 Proper, or, Common.</p>
               <p>Those Charges are said to be proper, which
by a certain property do particularly belong
to this Art, and are of ordinary use there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
in regard whereof they are called Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries:
And they have also the Title of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Ordinaries, in that the Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
is much honoured thereby, forasmuch
as they are oftentimes given by Emperours,
Kings, and Princes, as Additions of Honour
unto the Coat-Armours of Persons of Desert,
for some special Service already past, or upon
hope of some future worthy Merit. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
(as <hi>Leigh</hi> sheweth) they are also called,
Most worthy Partitions, in respect that albeit
the Field be charged in divers parts thereof,
whether with things of one or of divers
kinds, yet is every of them as effectual as if
it were only one by the Soveraignty of these
Partitions being interposed between them.</p>

the matter whereof these Ordinaries are form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and according to the divers Tracts and

shape and variation of Names. For this cause
Lines must be duly considered, and especially
their Properties; in speaking whereof, I must

               <p>Rightness is a property of a Line whereby

streight Lines, you must only name the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,

the manifold sorts of crooked Lines, the form

               <p>HAving spoken of the Properties of Lines,
so much as serves for our intended pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
let us next take a view of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
kinds of those Lines, as far forth as they
have use in Heraldry.</p>
               <p>For they are used <list>

               <p>Of both which kinds and forms are all the
Honourable Ordinaries composed, as we shall
shew hereafter. And first for the single Lines
and their use, it is to be understood, that one
single Line doth make that sort of Ordinary
which we name a Chief. A Chief is an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
determined by some one of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
forms of Lines aforesaid, added to the
Chief part of the Escocheon: As in Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>And as the Head is the chief part in a man,
so the chief in the Escocheon should be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of such only, whose high merits have
procured them chief place, esteem, or love
amongst men. This Ordinary in our Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
you see is formed of a streight Line:
you must therefore in the Blazon thereof,
only name the kind of Ordinary (as before
we admonished) making no mention at all of
the streightness of the Line: but if the same,
or any other Ordinary be framed of any other
form than streight, then must you expresly
mention the form of the Line whereof such
Ordinary is composed, be it Bend, Cheuron,
Fess, Saltire, &amp;c. shewing the same to be either
Invecked, Engrailed, Wavy, Indented,
&amp;c.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Chiefs are made of all those several forms of
Lines beforementioned, as well as other Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,

               <p>HItherto hath our Pencil drawn out to
your view, a single Line, which doth
create an Ordinary, or some other of
the Charges last mentioned, it resteth that I
shew what a manifold Line is, and the use
thereof, according to the project of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
Method. I call that a Manifold Line,
when as more than one Line are required to the
perfecting of an Ordinary.</p>
               <p>Manifold Lines are <list>
                     <item>Twofold.</item>
                     <item>More than twofold.</item>

               </p>
               <p>Twofold Lines I understand to be there,
where is constituted an Ordinary of two Lines.
Of which kind of Ordinaries are these only,
<hi>viz.</hi> The Pale, Bend, Fess, Barr, Quarter,
Canton, and their like, as shall appear by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in their several places: First of a Pale.</p>
               <p>A Pale is an Ordinary consisting of two
Lines drawn perpendicularly from the Top to
the Base of the Escocheon, comprehending the
third part of the Escocheon. The content of
the Pale must not be enlarged, whether it be
charged or not.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>This Ordinary is subdivided into <list>
                     <item>Pallet.</item>
                     <item>Endorse.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>A Pallet is the moiety, or one half of the
Pale, and thereof receiveth his name of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution,
as being a Demy or little Pale. And
an Endorse is the Fourth part of a Pallet. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of each ensueth.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>Now from the Pale, and the several Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisions
thereof, let us come to the Bend, and
the distinct parts of the same. A Bend is an
Ordinary consisting also of twofold Lines
drawn overthwart the Escocheon, from the
Dexter Chief to the Sinister base point of the
same, so that the exact point of the Dexter
and Sinister corners thereof, may answer to the
precise midst of those Equidistant Lines
whereof the Bend is made: As in Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The Bend seemeth to have its Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the French word <hi>Bender,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
to stretch forth, because it is extended
betwixt those opposit points of the Escocheon,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Dexter Chief, and the Sinister Base.
Yet in ancient Rules I find the Bend drawn
somewhat Arch-wise, or after the resemblance
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55096:28"/>
of the bent of a Bow. Notwithstanding, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to some Armorists, it doth represent
a Ladder set aslope on this manner, to scale
the Walls of any Castle or City, as shall be
shewed hereafter, and betokeneth the Bearer
to have been one of the first that mounted
upon the Enemies Walls. This Bend drawn
from the right side to the left, is called a Bend
Dexter; but you shall also find a Bend exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drawn like to this on the contrary side, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Leginning from the left corner of the
Chief, and his termination in the Dexter base
point of the Escocheon, for which cause it is
named a Bend Sinister, as in Example here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
shall illustrate. In Blazoning of Bends,
if the same be Dexter, you shall only say, He
bears a Bend, not using the word Dexter;
but if it be drawn from the Sinister Chief to
the Dexter Base, then you must in Blazon by
no means omit the word Sinister.</p>
               <p>Note, That the Bend, and divers other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries
following, are subject to exemption
or voiding. Voiding (as earst we shewed)
is the exemption of some part of the inward
substance of things voidable, by occasion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Field is transparent through the
Charge, leaving only the outward Edges,
bearing the colour and quantity of the Charge,
as appeareth in this next Escocheon.</p>

               <p>Argent, a Bend engrailed, Gules, is the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

state of ours; for so hath God ordained
that they should be means to win and bring
us to himself, therefore must we receive them
patiently, as the evident tokens of Gods great
Love and Mercy. As the Preacher admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55096:28"/>
us, saying, <hi>Whatsoever cometh unto thee,
receive it patiently, and be patient in the
change of thine afflictions; for as Gold and
Silver is tried in the fire, even so are men
acceptable in the furnace of Adversity. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in God and he will help thee, order
thy way aright, and trust in him, hold fast his
fear, and grow old therein.</hi>

               <p>Thus much may suffice touching the Bend
Dexter, and the Subdivision thereof: Let us
now consider the Bend Sinister, and how the
same is subdivided. A Bend Sinister is an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
consisting of a twofold Line, drawn
traverse the Escocheon, from the Sinister chief
corner to the Dexter base point; and differeth
(as we said) from the Dexter Bend only in this,
that it is placed on the opposite part of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheon,
as in Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The Bend Sinister is subdivided into a <list>
                     <item>Scarp.</item>
                     <item>Battoon.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>A Scarp (as <hi>Leigh</hi> noteth) is that kind of
Ornament (much in use with Commanders
in the Field) which we do usually call a Scarf,
as may be gathered by the derivation thereof
from the French word <hi>Escharpe,</hi> signifying
that Ornament which usually is worn by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
men after the same manner from the left
Shoulder overthwart the Body, and so under
the Arm on the right side, as in Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>It is not lawful for those that are base born

it be branded with certain Notes or Marks
proper to men Illegitimate, devised of set pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

as proceed from lawful Matrimony. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
it is often questioned, Whether such as
be illegitimated (by Act of Parliament, or
whatsoever other means) may bear, or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
the bearing of the Arms of their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Fathers? Some are of Opinion they may:
Others do hold the contrary, unless they do

                  </gap>ear them with the apposition of some of the
beforementioned Notes appropriated to the
quality of their Illegitimate Generation and
Procreation. By Legitimate Issue, is not to
be understood Legitimate only, that is to say,
such as be adopted Children: For there is in
such but a bare imitation of Nature, of such
we have no use in this Land of Adoption or
Arrogation. But of such as are both Natural
and Legitimate; Natural so termed, <hi>Quia na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur

               <p>Consanguinity is a Bond or Link of Persons
descended of the same Stock, derived from Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Propagation: So called, <hi>Consanguinitas,
quasi sanguinis unitas, viz.</hi> the unity or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of Blood.</p>
               <p>To discern priority or nearness in Blood, two
things must be regarded principally; <hi>viz. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi>

together the Persons containing their
Degrees, and distinguishing them in their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
This is called <hi>Collectio Personarum.</hi>
The other, <hi>viz. Gradus,</hi> sheweth the state
or condition of the distant Persons, how near
they be, or how far distant asunder (in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
from their common Stock, or either
from other. This is called <hi>Habitudo distanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um

               <p>The Descending Line, is from me to my Son,
Nephew, his Son, downwards.</p>
               <p>The Collateral Line is placed on either side.</p>
               <p>This Line also is twofold, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>The Equal Collateral is that, where equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Persons differ from their Common Stock:
as Brothers and Sisters be equally distant from
their Father: As also Brothers and Sisters Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
from their Grandfather.</p>
               <p>The Unequal Collateral is, where one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth

               <p>Affinity is (after the Laws) <hi>Personarum
proximitas proveniens ex justis nuptiis;</hi> A
nearness of Persons proceeding from lawful
Marriage. So called <hi>Affinitas, quasi duorum
ad unum finem unitas;</hi> A union or consolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of two that be of divers Kindreds by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
or other Copulation conjoyned.</p>
               <p>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The first is thus contracted; My Brother and
I are Consanguine in the first degree, He ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a Wife, her they call, <hi>personam additam
personae per carnis copulam.</hi> This is the first
kind of Affinity (contracted by means of my
Brother) <hi>viz.</hi> between his Wife and me, and
the first degree: for thus they be the Kindred
and Degrees) discerned in Affinity, <hi>viz.</hi> by
the persons that be in Consanguinity or Blood,
either nearer or farther off. As for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</p>
               <p>My Brother is in the first degree to me in
Consanguinity; his Wife in Affinity: My Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Son in the second, his Nephew in the
third, his Nephews Son in the fourth. They
in Consanguinity: Their Wives in the same
degrees, second, third, or fourth unto me,
but they in Affinity.</p>
               <p>Note that they attain not (in me) by their
addition that, I have attained (by Blood)
in the persons to whom they be added. For
herein, that is to say, in Attinency we be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
in Consanguinity and Affinity. To
make it plain: My Brother is my Consanguine,
his Wife my Affine, only they retain and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
with me the degree, whether it be first,
second, third, or fourth; that I have with the
persons that they be carnally known by, the
which they alter not.</p>
               <p>Consequently they shall be every person in
Consanguinity to my Wife, in Affinity to me,
in what degree in the one, in that degree in the
other. But always in the first kind, be they
Brother, Sister, Nephew, Neece, &amp;c. But to

and by the Name it may seem to be some sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>division
of the Bend. It hath yet no certain
quantity, but containeth evermore a sixth part
of the Field (according to the observation of
<hi>Leigh</hi>) whereof you have an Example in this

               <p>OUR prefixed Order doth now call upon
me to bend my course from bends,
with the parts and subdivisions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and to proceed to the Fess, which chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth
the next place.</p>
               <p>The Fess is an Ordinary, formed of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Line, drawn overthwart the breadth of
the Escocheon; in the midst whereof is the
very Center of the Shield. And it containeth
the third part of the Field, and may not be
diminished, albeit the French Heralds do bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon
three bars gemels, for a Fess of six pieces.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>This Girdle of Honour may seem to have
been in ancient time given by Emperours and
Kings, and their Generals of the Field unto
Souldiers, for reward of some special Service
performed by them: and it is not improbable,
that such a reward it was, that the General of
<hi>David</hi>'s Army, <hi>Ioab,</hi> would have given the
Messenger that brought him news that <hi>Absa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi>
was hanged by the hair of the Head in an
Oak, if he had slain him; where <hi>Ioab</hi> saith,
<hi>Why hast thou not killed him, that so I might
have rewarded thy Service with ten Sheckles
of Silver, and a Girdle (or an arming
Belt</hi>)? For some translate it <hi>Cingulum,</hi> some
<hi>Baltheum.</hi> Amongst the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> it was
ordained by a Military Law (saith <hi>Alex. ab
Alex.</hi>) that the Souldier that had not killed an
Enemy, <hi>non militari Cingulo, sed capistro cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geretur:</hi>
should not be girt with an arming
Girdle, but with a Halter. And not without
reason is a man adorned with a Military Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
signifying he must be always in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to undergo the business of the Weal Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
for the more speedy performance of
which Charge, he should have his Garments
close girt unto his body, that the loosness of
them should give no impediment to the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his assumed Charge and enjoyned
Services. And these Tokens of Chivalry were
so highly esteemed in ancient times, that St.
<hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, in his Age, <hi>Duces, &amp; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes,
omnes etiam militantes, operosis Cingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
auro fulgente pretiosis, ambiunt, &amp;c.</hi> Great
Captains, Princes, and Martial Men, delight
to wear their Belts curiously wrought, and glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
with Gold, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As the bestowing of this Military Girdle,
was reputed very honourable, because none
were to receive it but Men of Merit, so also
was it ever accounted most dishonourable for
any just cause to be again deprived of the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
thereof; neither should such an one be
restored thereunto, but upon very singular and
especial Desert, as <hi>Ferettus</hi> noteth, where
he saith, <hi>Augustus laudabiliter militarem
disciplinam gessit severissime: &amp; privatos mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litari
Cingulo nunquam restituit, nisi illos prae
caeteris virtutum merita insignirent: Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
the Emperour got much honour by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of his Military Discipline: for if a man
were once deprived of his arming Girdle, he
never would restore it, unless he performed
some excellent Service above all others. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
there is also one kind of putting
off the Belt, of no less honour, than the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on of it; yea, much more glorious it is,
in that it is the end and perfection of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and that is, when the Victory is atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Victory being the end of Arming, as Peace
is of Battel. To which purpose is that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
1. <hi>Reg. 20. 11. Ne jactet se qui se accin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git,
ut qui discingit: Let not him boast who
girds himself, as he that doth ungird:</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we must not triumph (as the saying is)
before Victory; but it being once attained, it
is the Honour of a Generous Mind, to put off
his Belt, and not to Sanguine his Blade with
cold blood. For those Gallants, who in times
and places of Peace, are still drawing their
Swords like Warriours, in times and places of
War, prove (for the most part) peaceabler
and calmer than they should be.</p>
               <p>But if a Knight be disarmed of his Military
Girdle by his Demerits and Offence, he is
therewithal deprived of all Military Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
like as it fareth with a Captain, who (if
he happen to lose his Ensigns) is disabled to
advance any other in the Field, until he hath
either regained the same, or by his Valour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
some other from the Enemy. Which
kind of deprivation of Knights and Martial
Men for any notable transgression, was of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
use in times past, and in some places is
continued unto this day with greater severity
and much more infamy than in former times.

The depriving of the Belt (which

is at this day still in use amongst
Knights, and with more ignominy than was
in ancient times: which is nothing else but
that which we call degrading of a Knight. If
any ask me, How this comes about that such
Degradation of a Knight is more infamous
than of old? I answer, it is because it is more
rare, and therefore more remarkable. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
you ask, Why it is more rare than of
old? I answer, because it is more infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
and therefore Princes more unwilling
to inflict it. Howsoever, the truth is, that
base and unknightly actions and qualities, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a base and unknightly chastisement.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>So much of a Fess: now of a Chevron. A
Chevron is an Ordinary, formed of a twofold
Line Spirewise or Pyramidal; the Foundation
being in the Dexter and Sinister base points
of the Escocheon, and the acute Angle of
the Spire near to the top of the Escocheon:
As in Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The Content of the Chevron is the fifth
part of the Field (according to <hi>Leigh</hi>): but
<hi>Chassanaeus</hi> reckoneth the same amongst those
Ordinaries that do occupy the third part of the
Field. You may have two Chevrons in one
Field (saith <hi>Leigh</hi>) but not above; and if they
exceed that number, then shall you call them
Chevron ways. But I suppose they might be
termed much better Chevronels; that is to
say, minute or small Chevrons; for so is their
blazon more certain. This Charge following,
and the Subdivisions thereof, are diversly born,
as well in respect of the divers location, as of
the variable form thereof; for sometimes it is
born on chief, otherwhiles on base, sometimes

               <p>Hitherto of a Barr: Now of a Gyron.</p>
               <p>A Gyron is an Ordinary consisting of two
streight Lines drawn from divers parts of the
Escocheon, and meeting in an acute Angle in
the Fess point of the same. A Gyron (as one
saith) is the same that we call in Latin <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium,</hi>
which signifieth a Lap, and is the space
between the Thighs; and thence perchance do
we call the <hi>Groyn;</hi> which name, whether it
be given to this Charge, because it determines
<hi>in gremio,</hi> in the very lap or midst of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheon,
or because it hath a bending like the
Thigh and Leg together, I cannot define.
Gyrons are born diversly, <hi>viz.</hi> single, by cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
of six, of eight, of ten, and of twelve,
as shall appear hereafter, where I shall speak
of Arms having no tincture predominating.
For the making this Ordinary, behold this
next Escocheon, where you shall find one single
Gyron alone, which doth best express the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
thereof: as in Example.</p>

               <p>So much of a Gyron: Now of a Canton and
Quarter.</p>
               <p>A Canton is an Ordinary framed of two
streight Lines, the one drawn perpendicularly
from the Chief, and the other transverse from
the side of the Escocheon, and meeting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
in an acute Angle, near to the corner of
the Escocheon, as in this next appeareth.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Hitherto of a Canton, now of a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The Quarter is an Ordinary of like compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
with the Canton, and holdeth the same
places, and hath great resemblance thereof;
insomuch as the same Rules and Observations
that do serve for the one, may be attributed
to the other, <hi>Quia similium similis est ratio;</hi>
of like things the reason is alike. The only
difference between them is, that the Canton
keepeth only a cantle or small portion of the
corner of the Escocheon, and the Quarter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
the full fourth part of the Escoche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
as in Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Having spoken of the Canton and Quarter,
as much as for this present is requisite, I will
reserve some other their adjuncts to a more
convenient place. And will now speak of a
Pile, shewing some variable Examples of the
divers bearing thereof.</p>
               <p>A Pile is an Ordinary consisting of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Line, formed after the manner of a Wedge;
that is to say, broad at the upper end, and so
lessening by degrees throughout with a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>The Pile I take to be derived from <hi>Pilum,</hi>
an ancient Weapon peculiar to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
shaped somewhat like a Dart without Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but thicker at the great end, and wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
smaller Taper-wise, being about five foot
in length, and sharpned at the point with
Steel: And such were the offensive Arms of
the <hi>Hastati</hi> and <hi>Principes,</hi> as <hi>Polybius</hi> of the

               <p>Sometimes you shall find this Ordinary born
transposed or reversed, contrary to the usual
form of their bearing, <hi>viz.</hi> with their points
upward, which naturally ought to be down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
being supposed to be a piece of Timber,
whose neither part is sharpned, to the end it
may be more commodiously driven into the
ground; as in Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The Pile is an ancient Addition to Armory,
and is a thing that maketh all Foundations to
be firm and perfect, especially in Water-works.</p>
               <p>When there is but one Pile in the Field, it
must contain the third part of the same at the
Chief. This Ordinary is diversly formed and
born, as in these next Escocheons appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

               <p>Now the bearing of Waves, or of things
waved, may well fit those that are tried in the
furnace of Afflictions, which are the Badges
and Testimonies of our election in Christ, who
suffered for us; the Just for the Unjust, to bring
us unto God. Therefore we should bear our
Afflictions gladly, forasmuch as <hi>if we suffer
with Christ, we shall also be glorified with him.</hi>
For so doth the Apostle admonish us, saying,
<hi>That no man should be moved with these affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
for ye your selves know that we are
appointed thereunto, 1 Thess.</hi> 3. 3. And again,
<hi>Thou therefore suffer affliction as a good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier

               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:55096:34"/>So much of Piles, and their variety, as well
of Form as of Location. There rest yet some
other sorts of Ordinaries, that are composed
of a two-fold Line, not hitherto spoken of.</p>
               <p>Such are these, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>Flasque.</item>
                     <item>Flanch.</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>In some mens conceit perhaps these Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
last mentioned might have been more fitly
placed amongst such as are before handled,
and are composed of a single Line (of which
number these may be well reckoned, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
them each one apart by themselves:) but
forasmuch as none of them are born single, but
always by couples; for conveniency I have
chosen rather to sort them with these that are
formed of a twofold Line: and first of a
Flasque.</p>
               <p>A Flasque is an Ordinary consisting of one
Arch-line, drawn somewhat distant from the
corners of the Chief, and meanly swelling by
degrees until you come towards the midst of
the Escocheon, and from thence again decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
with a like comly descent unto the Sinister
base points; as in Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The next in Order is the Flanch, which is
an Ordinary formed of an Arch-line, taking its
beginning from the corner of the Chief, and
from thence compassing orderly with a swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
embossment, until it come near to the
Nombril of the Escocheon, and thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
declining to the Sinister base point,
as in this next Escocheon.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Last of all in our Ordinaries, cometh the
Voider, consisting of one Arch-line moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bowing from the corner of the Chief by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
towards the Nombril of the Escocheon,
and from thence in like sort declining, until it
come unto the Sinister base, and hath a more
near resemblance of the bent of a Bow than the
Flanch hath, in that it riseth not with so deep
a compass; as in Example.</p>

               <p>HAving shewed the manner and making
of such Ordinaries as are composed of
a twofold Line; we will now proceed
to that other Member of the Distribution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
delivered, which maketh mention of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries
consisting of Lines more than twofold;
and will shew how they also are made.</p>
               <p>Such Ordinaries do consist of Lines <list>
                     <item>Threefold.</item>
                     <item>Fourfold.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Those that are formed of a threefold Line,
are the Inescocheon and the Orle.</p>
               <p>The Inescocheon is an Ordinary formed of a
threefold Line, representing the shape of the
Escocheon; as in Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The next in rank of this kind is the Orle,
which is an Ordinary composed of a threefold
line duplicated, admitting a transparency of the
Field, throughout the innermost <hi>Area</hi> or space
therein inclosed. This hath the form of an
Inescocheon, but hath not the solid substance
thereof, being evermore voided, as in these
following Examples appeareth.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>As touching the doubling of this plain Orle,
I will not here give Example, for that I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to present to your view a threefold Orle
or Tract, which doth include the twofold, as
in this next Escocheon appeareth.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>Hitherto have we considered the making of
such Ordinaries as are composed of a threefold
Line: Our Order calleth me now to speak of
such Ordinaries as do require a fourfold Line
for the effecting of them.</p>
               <p>Of this sort is the
 <list>
                     <item>Cross.</item>
                     <item>Saltire.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The Cross is an Ordinary composed of a
four-fold Line, whereof two are Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and the other two are transverse, for so
we must conceive of them, though they are
not drawn throughout, but meet by couples
in four acute Angles near about the Fess point
of the Escocheon; to look upon (if they were
couped, as they are sometimes found) like to
four Carpenters squares; as the Example fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
will demonstrate. This Ordinary is
called <hi>Crux, à cruciando,</hi> or <hi>à cruciatu,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the unspeakable torture and torment
which they do suffer, who undergo this kind
of death. The Content of the Cross is not
the same always: for when it is not charged,
then it hath only the fifth part of the Field; but
if it be charged, then must it contain the third
part thereof. To give you particular Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of all the different forms of bearing of the
Cross, were as needless as endless, considering
the variety set down by other Authors: I
will therefore content my self with these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing.</p>

               <p>This Coat was also born by <hi>Henry Rayns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>

of Sir <hi>Thomas Hussey</hi> of <hi>Hemington</hi> in

               <p>Azure, a Cross, Or: This Coat-Armour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to the right worshipful Family of <hi>Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
in the County of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> whence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
that honourable vertuous Lady, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Shelton,</hi> who was many years of the most
honourable Bedchamber of that glorious Queen
<hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and was also wife to the right
worshipful Sir <hi>Iohn Scudamore</hi> of <hi>Home Lacy</hi>
in the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Hereford,</hi> Knight, Standard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer
to her Majesties Honourable Band of
Gentlemen Pensioners. This Ordinary is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
diversly named, according to the diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Lines whereof it is composed: For as it
is the form of Lines whereof it is made, so is
the Denomination thereof. In the ancientest
Institution of the bearing of the Cross (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all controversie) it had this form; which
is taken to be the true shape of the Cross
whereupon our blessed Saviour Christ Jesus suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered:
whose godly observation and use was in
great esteem in the Primitive Church; though
in latter times it hath been dishonourably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by two opposed kinds of Fantasticks:
the one, who so superstitiously dote on it, that
they adore it like their God: the other, who so
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55096:35"/>
unchristianly detest it, that they slander the
most godly and ancient use thereof, in our first
initiating unto Christ, as if it were some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish
Idol. But the true Souldiers of such
a Captain need not to be ashamed to bear their
Generals Ensign. And this bearing was first
bestowed on such as had performed, or at least
undertaken some Service for Christ and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Profession: and therefore being duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
I hold it the most honourable Charge
to be found in Heraldry. But the form and
bearing hereof (as well as the Chevrons for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
spoken of) hath been also depraved
through the inconsiderate handling of common
Painters. For which cause I have caused this
precedent Cross only to be cut after this fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in the rest I have ensued the vulgar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
bearing of how used, choosing rather to
sway with the multitude in matters of small
importance, than that I would seem to affect
I know not what singularity; <hi>Nemo enim er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantem
arguit, qui cum multis errat.</hi> This
manner bearing of the patible Cross is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by Rolls of greatest Antiquity, and it is
most consonant to Reason, that the stem there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
should be much longer than the cross part,
by how much it was requisite that the same
was to be deeply fixed in the Ground: So then
if we shall compare this ancient bearing with
that of modern times, we shall find this to be
natural, and that adulterate.</p>
               <p>Crosses do receive manifold varieties of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination,
according to the multiplicity of
their different shapes, and variable properties
of Lines whereof they are formed.</p>
               <p>The bearing of the Cross, is the express note
or badge of a Christian that he bear the same
according to the prescript, rule, and will of his
Lord and Master. For as <hi>Barth.</hi> saith, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signia
ad voluntatem Domini sunt portanda,
&amp; non alias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All Crosses may signifie unto us Tribulations
and Afflictions, which (how burthensome so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they may seem to the flesh) yet is there
much comfort to be found in them, to those
that make a right use of them, and do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
the burthen of them chearfully, and without
recalcitration. For it is the property of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
that have been dandled (as I may say)
in Fortunes lap, and pampered with worldly
delights to forget both God and themselves,
and in their fulness to spurn and kick up the
heel, according to that saying of <hi>Moses</hi> in his
Song that he made a little before his death;
<hi>But he that should have been upright, when
he waxed fat, spurned with his heel: He was
fat, he was gross, he was laden with fatness,
therefore he forsook God that made him, and
regarded not the strong God of his Salvation,
Deut.</hi> 30. 15.</p>
               <p>Since then our Lord and Master (for our
sakes) did willingly take upon him this grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
and almost unsupportable Burthen, why
should we then, that would be counted his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Souldiers and Servants shrink thereat;
especially since by the Discipline of the Cross,
we are brought to the true knowledge of God,
his Omnipotency, Wisdom, Justice, Mercy,
and all other his Divine Attributes, and of our
own miserable and damnable Estate, through
our adherent and inherent corruption of sins,
as well Actual, as Original.</p>
               <p>A like form of bearing of this, is that Cross
which we find born in the Shield of St. <hi>George,</hi>
but diversly from this, both in Metal and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour:
which of some Armorists of <hi>Vptons</hi>
time (as himself noteth in his <hi>Discourse of
Arms</hi>) received in those days a very strange
and absurd kind of Blazon, which he there set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
down after this manner; the Shield, Gules,
four Quarters, Argent: whose reason herein
(saith he) I do not allow, for that by such
manner of Blazon, the bearing of a plain Cross
shall never be known. Moreover, herein also
may we observe the Blazon hereof to be er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ròneous,
in that they say, Four Quarters:
which are indeed but so many Cantons; else
should they all four meet in the Center of
the Escocheon. This Ordinary is subject to
voiding and couping, as these Examples fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
shew.</p>

               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>As this Cross is formed of bunched Lines, so
are there others that are composed of sundry
other sorts of Lines before shewed, as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
will inform you, and as you may in part
see by the Example following.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Of all other sorts of Crosses, the Cross wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
is a more special note of Tribulation, in
regard it representeth the turbulent Waves or
Surges of the Seas, occasioned by some turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
gust or flaw of boystrous winds or storms,
causing a success of surging Billows; notifying
unto us consequent Afflictions and Troubles
following immediately one upon anothers
neck, which the Children of God must sustain
with a constant resolution, following therein
the instruction of <hi>Ecclesiasticus 2. 1. My Son,
if thou wilt come into the service of God,
stand fast in righteousness and fear, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
thy Soul unto temptation.</hi> And again,
<hi>Settle thy heart and be patient, bow down
thine ear, and receive the words of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and shrink not away when thou art
assailed, but wait upon God patiently: Ioyn
thy self unto him, and depart not away, that
thou mayest be increased at thy last end,

have formerly shewed in

a Cross crowchee, for the resemblance
that it hath of a Crutch, which <hi>Chaucer</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
a Potent, which is properly figetive: For
were it that the overthwart or cross part here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
should be exempted, then would the middle
part shew it self to be a perfect Crutch, used
for the slay and sustentation of feeble and aged
persons. Like as old Age is a blessing of God,
so contrariwise it is a Token of his heavy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
to be cut off before a man shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
thereto: As appeareth by that saying of
God unto <hi>Eli</hi> the Priest, <hi>Behold, the days
come that I will cut off thine Arm, and the
Arm of thy Fathers House, that there shall not
be an old man in thine house,</hi> 1 Sam. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

again, <hi>And there shall not be an old man in
thy house for ever,</hi> Verse 32. And further, <hi>And
all the multitude of thine house shall dye when
they be men,</hi> Verse 33. Moreover, it is said in
the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> on the contrary part,
<hi>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, There shall yet
old men and old women dwell in the Streets
of Ierusalem; and every man with his Staff
in his hand for very Age:</hi> Whereby is meant,
that God would preserve them in life, so long
as Nature might sustain them.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Whereas I have formerly made mention of

               <figure/>
               <p>There is another Accident whereunto this
Ordinary is subject, that is to say, Piercing.
Piercing is a penetration or perforation of
things that are of solid substance. And it is
threefold:

saith) that if it stood Saltire-ways, then should
you call it <hi>Ferre de Molin,</hi> that is to say, a
Mill-rind, or the Ink of a Mill: which to me
seemeth a very Paradox, that transposition
(being a thing meerly accidental) should give
a new denomination to the thing transposed,
and consequently alter the essence thereof:
<hi>Quia novum nomen dat novum esse rei;</hi> where
are new names, new things are supposed to be.
It were a thing worthy of admiration, that
Accidents should have such power in them:
For <hi>Aristotle, Physicorum</hi> 1. saith, <hi>Accidentia
possunt miraculose, &amp; non alias mutare subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum;</hi>
Accidents change not their Subject but by
Miracle. Addition doubtless and Subtraction,
are of greater force than Transmutation or
Location; yet is there no such power in them
as that they can alter the essence of any thing:
<hi>Quia augmentum vel diminutio</hi> (saith <hi>Chassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>) <hi>circa accidentia contractuum, non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponunt
contractum in diverso esse, neque per ea
intelligitur ab eo in substantialibus recessus:</hi>
the adding or diminishing of Accidents makes
not the thing lose the nature of his being.</p>

pierced, for that the piercing is square as a

thereof: Now of that other Ordinary that is

Saltire.</p>
               <p>A Saltire is an Ordinary consisting of a four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Line, whereof two are drawn from the
Dexter chief towards the Sinister base corners,
and the other from the Sinister chief towards
the Dexter base points, and do meet about
the midst by couples in acute Angles. I know
the Learned Geometer will find many more
Lines here than I do mention: but (as I said
of Lines in the Cross) this our description
greeth best with Heralds, and our purpose.</p>

the Walls therewith, to which end, the Pins
served commodiously. In those days (saith

               <p>The Field is Argent, two Bends, Gules. This
Coat-Armour I find in an ancient Manuscript of
Collection of Englishmens Arms in Metal and
Colours, with the Blazon in French, of the time
of our <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, as it is apparent by
the Character of the Letter: over which Coat-Armour
is there written the Bearers name,
<hi>viz.</hi> Monsieur <hi>Iohn Haget;</hi> from whom Mr.
<hi>Bartholomew Haget,</hi> late Consul of <hi>Aleppo,</hi>
deriveth his descent. This Book at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

Friend of mine, a curious Collector and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Preserver of such ancient Monuments.</p>

of the Forest of <hi>Dean,</hi> in right of his Wife,

proper Charges, together with
their making, and divers manner of bearing:
the same orderly Progression now calleth us
to the handling of common Charges, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in the second Member of the same Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution.
By common Charges I mean all
such other Charges hereafter following, as are

               <p>Things Natural (according to Philosophers)
are Essences by themselves subsisting: <hi>Res na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalis
est essentia per se subsistens.</hi> Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
and in manner infinite are these things
Natural, as <hi>Zanchius</hi> noteth, saying, <hi>Multae
sunt, &amp; propè infinitae, non tam res, quàm
rerum species, in Coelis, in Aere, in Terris,
in Aquis:</hi> therefore it is not to be expected,
that I should in exemplifying of them, pass
through all the particulars of them; but only
touch superficially some of their chiefest, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
out of that innumerable variety, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I may manifest in what ranks, and under
what heads, each peculiar thing must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed,
according to their several kinds, and
so redeem them from all former confused mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Of things Natural, some are <list>
                     <item>Formal.</item>
                     <item>Material.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The formal Nature is most simple and pure,
and consisteth of the propriety of its own
form, without any body at all; of which
sort are Spirits, which (according to <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonius</hi>
are <hi>Essentiae formatae rationales &amp;
immortales;</hi> Essences perfectly formed, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
and immortal: I say, perfectly form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to distinguish them from the Souls of men,
whose forming is not perfect in it self, but is
for the informing and perfecting of the Body
and the whole Man.</p>
               <p>Amongst such Forms are numbred <list>
                     <item>Angels.</item>
                     <item>Cherubims.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Angels, in the Opinion of most men) are
incorporeal Essences of a spiritual Nature, void
of all material Substance. <hi>Angelus</hi> in Latin,
is the same that <hi>Nuntius</hi> is, that is to say a
Messenger; and the same is a name of Office,
and not of Nature, as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> noteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Psalm</hi> 104. saying, <hi>Quaeris nomen hujus
naturae? Spiritus est. Quaeris officium? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelus est.</hi>
Will you know the nature of it?
It is a Spirit. Will you know the Office of it?
It is an Angel or Messenger. The like may
we find (saith he) in man: <hi>Nomen naturae
Homo, officii Miles: nomen naturae Vir, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficii
Praetor:</hi> To be a man, is a name of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
To be a Souldier or Pretor, is a name of
Office. Angels are Messengers, by whom God
hath manifested his will and power to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
in Christ Jesus: In which respect also the
Ministers of God are called in Scriptures Gods
Angels, and therefore to be honoured as his
Embassadours and Messengers; and their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is <hi>Evangelium,</hi> the good Angelical
Message of life eternal with the Angels in
Heaven.</p>
               <p>All Angels are of like spiritual Substance,
of like intelligent faculty, of like will and
choice; In fine, all of them created alike
good, and in nature perfect. Nevertheless,
as all men by nature and natural dignity are
alike, but by accident some of them are of
more esteem and worthiness than others: So
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55096:44"/>
it is also with Angels, inasmuch as some of
them (if we give credit to Philosophers) are
appointed to attend the motion of the Heavens,
others to repress the rage of Devils, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
<hi>Iob</hi> 8. Others have charge of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Kingdoms, and to keep under the
rage of Tyrants, as is manifest <hi>Daniel</hi> 20.
Some have charge of some particular Church,
others of Apostles and Pastors, and others of
private Persons, <hi>Psalm</hi> 91. And all of them
are by Scripture said to be <hi>Ministring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this diversity of Functions, and several
Administrations, it is thought (because some
of these Off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ces are of higher imployment
than others are) that some of them are sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
called Angels, some Archangels, some
Vertues, some Dominations, as St. <hi>Hierom</hi>
expresly sheweth.</p>
               <p>And albeit these heavenly Spirits be in their
own Nature void of all corporeal or material
Substance, yet is it certain, when it pleased
God so to imploy them, they had assumpted
Bodies for the time, to the end they might
then more effectually accomplish the service
that God had injoyned them. Such Bodies had
the three Angels that appeared to <hi>Abraham,
Gen.</hi> 18. Such Bodies also had the two Angels
that came unto <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 19. And as God
gave them Bodies for that time, so did he give
them also the Faculties answerable to such Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
<hi>viz.</hi> to walk, talk, eat, drink, and such
like. These Bodies and bodily Faculties
were given them, to the end they might more
familiarly converse and discourse with the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to whom they were sent, and the better
perform the charge enjoyned them, insomuch
as they did unfeignedly eat and drink, as <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi>
noteth; whereby they did the better
conceal their proper Nature, until such time
as they should make known unto men what
they were indeed. Hereupon it seemeth the
Ancients of fore-past Ages have used the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Angels in Coat-Armours, according to
those bodily shapes and habits wherein they
appeared unto men, as in Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>After Angels, Cherubims (whose use in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
is less frequent) are to be handled. Of
these I find two Examples of several bearing;
the one out of <hi>Hieron. Bara,</hi> expressing the
sole bearing of a Cherub: another out of <hi>Leigh,</hi>
of a Cherub born upon an Ordinary: to which
I have thought fit to add a Coat of Name,
for a more manifest proof of their use in Arms,
as also to shew that they are born as well
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55096:44"/>
with Ordinaries between them, as upon Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>In our Division we distinguished these from
<hi>Angels,</hi> because by most they are taken for a
distinct Order above ordinary Angels, taking
that Name from the fulness or abundance of
Divine and Mystical Science. Thus have you
Examples of Cherubims born, not only Sole,
but also upon and with Ordinaries.</p>

               <p>The Unmoveable is holden to be that ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost
Sphere that glistereth so gloriously, as
that it dazeleth the sharpest sight of man, and
is called <hi>Caelum Empyreum,</hi> the fiery Heaven;
whereof we shall be better able to judge and
speak, when God shall bring us thither, and
yet our Star-gazers will take upon them to
talk so confidently and particularly of those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
Bodies, as if they had been
there, and surveyed every corner thereof. This
Celestial Globe (according to <hi>Scribonius</hi>) is
the Mansion Place and Place of all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Natures, wherein the Angels, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the blessed of God, do with endless joy
behold the presence of Almighty God face to
face. To this place (according to the same
Author) were <hi>Enoch, Elias,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> rapt
up before their deaths.</p>
               <p>But now for more orderly progression here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
forasmuch as we have occasion here offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to speak of a Sphere, we will first shew
what a Sphere is, and so proceed to the rest.</p>
               <p>A Sphere is a figure or body exactly round
of all parts, and void of all Angles and Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
The spherical or round form is of all
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55096:45"/>
other the most perfect, as also the most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
capable, and fit for motion, in as much
as it is void of all corners, which might give
impediment to moving, therefore is this form
most agreeable to the Heavens and Celestial
Bodies, which are evermore in continual and
restless motion. It was requisite then, that
the perfectest Body (such as the Heavens are)
should receive the perfectest form, which is the
orbicular or round figure. <hi>Figura Sphaerica</hi>
(saith <hi>Aristotle, lib, de Coelo &amp; Mundo) est
omnium figurarum nobilior.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The motion of the Heavens is the most sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
and unlaboured of all motions,</hi> Movetur
enim sine labore, &amp; fatigatione, Arist. de
Coelo 2. <hi>As also it is said in</hi> Ecclesiast. 16. 26.
The Lord hath set his works in good order from
the beginning, and part of them be sundred
from the other, when the first made them. He
hath garnished his works for ever, and their
beginning so long as they shall endure: they
are not hungry, nor wearied in their labours,
nor cease from their offices, <hi>Verse 27. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi>
None of them hindreth another, neither
was any of them disobedient to his words,
<hi>Verse</hi> 28. He buildeth his Spheres in the
Heaven, and hath laid the foundations of
the Globe of Elements in the Earth: he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the waters of the Sea, and poureth
them out upon the open Earth; the LORD
is his Name, Amos 9. 6.</p>
               <p>The matter whereof the Heavens are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
hath in it this natural property, not to
be moved violently, neither yet naturally to
rest. As the same Author testifieth in these
words, <hi>Natura materiae Coeli est innatu non
movere violenter, &amp; non quiescere naturaliter,
Lib. de Coelo:</hi> without intermission is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Heavens. Therefore are high and
noble Spirits resembled to the Celestial Bodies
according to <hi>Lipsius, Alti aethereique animi,
ut ipse aether, semper gaudent motu:</hi> Men of
etherial or heavenly Spir its cannot be idle, but
are evermore in action, and exercise of things
commendable and vertuous, being thereto
moved and quickned by an honest and free dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
and affection of the will and desire of
the mind: <hi>Omnia enim honesta opera</hi> (saith
<hi>Seneca) voluntas inchoat, occasio perficit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But vertue hardly receiveth her due merit
at all seasons. Nevertheless, <hi>Saepe honorata
est virtus, etiam ubi eam fefellit exitus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The circular Motion receiveth beginning in
it self, and hath the smoothest passage: for in
all other forms you shall find Angels, either
more or less, which do give impediments to
motion, whereby they give occasion of some
stay or rest (as I have said before). There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it behooved, that the sincerest Body
should be fitted with the simplest form and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In this kind of motion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
is signified the very eternity of God,
wherein there is neither beginning nor ending
to be found; and therefore it is rightly said
by the Apostle, <hi>The invisible things of God
are conceived and understood by his creatures:</hi>
as also his Everlasting Power and Divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
whereof his visible works are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Characters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mercurius Trismegistus</hi> in his description of
God, resembleth him to a Sphere, saying,
<hi>Deus est Sphaera, qui ratione sapientiaque
comprehenditur, cujus centrum est ubique,
circumferentia verò nusquam, &amp;c.</hi> God is
a Sphere that is apprehended by reason, whose
center is every where, and his circumference
no where. For God hath neither beginning
nor ending: he wants beginning, because he
was not made by any, but was himself the
Creator of all things: And he is void of ending,
by reason that he had no beginning: <hi>Nam
quicquid finitur, in sua principiaresolvitur;</hi>
Whatsoever hath an end, the same is resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into that it was at the first.</p>
               <p>As touching the Substance of the Heavens,
<hi>Scribonius</hi> saith, that it is <hi>Corpus constans
ex aqua, in firmissimam essentiam instar pellis
extensae concameratum.</hi> It is a Body (saith
he) consisting of Water, in the most solid
Substance thereof spread out Vault-ways like
a Skin.</p>
               <p>Though it may seem to thee (courteous
Reader) that I undertake a needless labour in
manifesting that the glorious Heavens and
Earth, were formed and framed by the most
powerful God, a thing so frequent in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scriptures, and also so clear, as that no
man can doubt thereof: yet give me leave for
my own particular, who do labour to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
every occasion to publish the glory of the
Eternal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd Omnipotent God (which is the
main and principal end of our Creation) es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
since the Order of my Method requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the same; and that <hi>bonum aliquod saepius
repetitum delectat;</hi> Give me leave, I say, in
this my latter impression, to reprove my self
for my too much neglected duty in my former;
that so, though very late, yet at the last, I
may prefer the Glory of God before the Order
of Method.</p>
               <p>The Moveable Sphere of the Heaven is the
Firmament. The Firmament is that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
moving Heaven, which with his swift Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
swayeth all the Inferiour Orbs, and
is called in Latin <hi>Firmamentum</hi> (according to
<hi>Scribonius) à firmitate,</hi> that is, of the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
thereof; meaning (as I conceive) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the durable subsisting of it, or else the
unmoveableness of the two Poles, Artick and
Antartick: otherwise, one self same thing
cannot be said to be moveable and constant,
but in a diverse respect; even as an Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheel
in a Clock, though still in motion,
yet both in respect of the metalline solidity,
and of the sure fastning to the Axle, it may
be said to be Firm and Unmoveable. If any
man bear a representation of the Heavens,
in his Coat-Armour, whether the same have
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55096:45"/>
the likeness of a Solid or Armil Sphere, they
must be reduced to this head: of this kind did
the famous <hi>Archimede</hi> chuse for his Device,
who before his death, commanded that a
Sphere should be engraven on his Sepulchre.
And such a bearing is honourable for any great
Professor of <hi>Astronomy,</hi> not such witless Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
and Fortune-tellers as usually deceive the
World with their idle Predictions; but those
Noble Spirits, whose Eagle-eyes search out
the true Natures, Revolutions, and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of those Supernal Essences.</p>
               <p>The regardful consideration of the Heavens
and the Ornaments thereof, together with
their certain and orderly motions, should
mightily move and provoke us to raise up our
thoughts, from the love and contemplation of
base and earthly Objects (whereon we usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dote) to the admiration of his unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
power and love of his incomprehensible
goodness, who made such a wonderful Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture;
first, to serve for our use in this life;
and afterward, to be our blessed Palace and
Mansion in a better life. For though all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
demonstrate the wisdom of their wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Workmaster, yet the <hi>Heavens</hi> especially
<hi>declare his glory, and the Firmament his han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-work:</hi>
which made the godly King <hi>David</hi>
to rise out of his Bed in the night, to behold
the Heavens, and thereby to call to mind the
perversity of Man, which never keeps the
course that God prescribeth, whereas those
Bodies, though void of sense, yet from their
first Creation never faltered in their endless
journeys.</p>
               <p>Now since I have demonstrated and laid
open unto you what a Sphere is, the form,
perfection, dignity, property, motion, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
thereof, and the like, I will now shew
unto you an Example of a Shield, illustrated
with manifold variety of Celestial Bodies, &amp;c.
which will be very necessary and commodious
to be inserted in this place.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>These were the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
wherewith the
Shield of that famous
and valiant Grecian Captain <hi>Achilles</hi> was il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated
and garnished: Which he caused to be
engraven therein, to the end that the mind
of the beholders of them might be raised
thereby to a considerate contemplation and
meditation of the admirable power and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Omnipotent Creator of them:
Which duty whosoever performeth, he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisheth
the sum and effect of all true Nobility.</p>
               <p>This Shield did <hi>Vulcan</hi> garnish with variety
of Stars of manifold kinds, and added thereto
the skilful feats and practises, as well of Peace
as of Wars, and all their rights and offices;
omitting (in a manner) nothing pertaining
to the well-governing of the Assemblies and
Societies of Men.</p>
               <p>By this invention did he labour to manifest
unto us, than there is no Shield more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to resist the vehement and violent assaults
of adverse Fortune; that for a man to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
throughout with the compleat Armour
of Cardinal Vertues, so shall he be fitted and
prepared to sustain whatsoever brunt or forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
encounter shall assail them.</p>
               <p>If we shall compare this Shield of <hi>Achilles,</hi>
thus garnished and furnished, with manifold
varieties of things, both Celestial and Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial,
with those Coat-Armours that consist
of Lyons, Griffins, Eagles, and such other
Animals, or ravenous Creatures, we shall find
that to be more available to chase away and
foil all passionate perturbations of the mind,
occasioned by the concurrence of some sudden
and unexpected danger, than any, or all of
these together can be; by how much that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priseth
a mixture of calamities and comforts
together. For as the Globe of the Earth doth
represent unto us the dreadful and dismal dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
that attend our mortal state, by reason of
the manifold mutability of things Sublunary,
to the daunting (oftimes) of the most vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant:
so contrariwise, the Celestial forms do
represent unto us an Antidote or Preservative
against all dangerous events and accidents,
when we call to mind that those Celestial pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
or rather Gods power in them, is able to
divert or mitigate in a moment all harmful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
and dangers whatsoever, be they never
so deadly. For these Celestial Bodies are Gods
mighty and strong Army, wherewith he often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
discomfiteth and subdueth his Enemies,
and such as seek the spoil and destruction of
his chosen people: as we may see <hi>Iudges 5.
20. They fought from heaven, even the Stars
in their courses fought against</hi> Sisera. <hi>The Sun
stayed his course at the prayer of</hi> Joshua, 10. 12.
<hi>And the Sun abode, and the Moon stood still,
until the people avenged themselves upon their
enemies,</hi> Verse 13. <hi>And there was no day like
that before it, nor after it, that the Lord
hearkned to the voice of man, for the Lord
fought for Israel.</hi> And again, <hi>Ecclesiast. 46.
4. Stood not the Sun still by his means, and one
day was as long as two,</hi> Verse 14.</p>
               <p>By these visible forms we should be incited
and provoked (upon their view) to invocate
the most powerful God for his aid and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
when we find our selves any way
distressed or beset with perils by the Example
of <hi>Ioshua:</hi> He called unto the most High Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
when the Enemies pressed upon him
on every side, and the mighty Lord heard
him, and fought for him with Hailstones,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55096:46"/>
and with mighty power. So should we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
like comfort in all distresses, as <hi>Iosua</hi>
did. Thus should their view put us evermore
in mind, to raise our thoughts to Godward,
and take every occasion to glorifie him, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating
him for his aid; and say with the
Kingly Prophet <hi>David, I lift my eyes to the
hills from whence cometh my help, &amp;c.</hi> So
should we evermore in all distresses find the
comfort of his ever ready, and never failing
promise and providence: <hi>For in all things, O
Lord, thou hast magnified and glorified thy
people, and hast not despised to assist them in
every time and place, Wisdom</hi> 29. 21.</p>
               <p>These kinds of Coat-Armours are so much
more noble and excellent, than these that we
receive by descent from our Progenitors (as
remunerations of their vertuous demerits) by
how much they have in them store of Art,
witty Invention, and of efficacy to admonish
and put us in mind to persist in the performance
of our Duties.</p>
               <p>This manner of adorning of Shields doth
<hi>Aldrovandus</hi> commend above all other gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishings,
saying, <hi>Nihil aequè atque Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,
ab omnibus adversis tuetur, nihil ejus
explicatu aptius est ad scutum exornandum
&amp; honestius.</hi> There is nothing that doth so
safely protect a man against the damage of
adverse Fortune, as Philosophy doth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any thing more fit and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to beautifie a Shield withal, than the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation
thereof.</p>
               <p>Emblems, Hieroglyphicks, and Ensigns of
Noble Families, inasmuch as they do instruct
our eyes unto vertue, they cannot be defaced
or blemished without great wickedness: The
reason thereof doth <hi>Farnesius</hi> give in these
words, <hi>Cum virtutum imaginibus tantum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus,
quantum mutis praeceptoribus: Si il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae
tamen mutae dici possunt, quae in silentio
omni Doctrinâ sunt verbosiora.</hi> Of all the
things that are (saith <hi>Cicero</hi>) there is nothing
in the world that is better, nothing more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
nothing more beautiful and glorious
to behold, and not only that there is, but that
nothing can be thought or imagined to be of
more surpassing beauty than the world; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<hi>Lipsius</hi> annexeth this addition, examine
the universality thereof, consider the great
and small parts thereof, and you shall find
them composed and compacted in such orderly
sort, as that they cannot possibly be bettered
for use, or more glorious to behold. The
consideration whereof moved King <hi>David</hi> to
break forth in admiration.</p>
               <p>The Spherical Figure is of all other forms
the fairest, the most capable, and the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plest,
and comprehendeth all other forms.
In a Spherical Line the end is all one with the
beginning, therefore it doth aptly agree with
the noblest and perfectest Body, such as the
Heavens are.</p>
               <p>There is nothing that more apparently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
the Spherical or round form of the
Heavens, than doth the Sun by his Circular
motion: <hi>The Sun,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, Eccles. 1. 5.
riseth and goeth down, and draweth to his
place where he riseth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the most simple body, the simplest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is due, as also the simplest form and
shape.</p>
               <p>Those things are said to be moved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
labour, which are moved without any
intermission or rest, or any appetite or desire
of rest; such is the motion of the Heavens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are Circular or Round: in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
motion there is no rest at all.</p>
               <p>That the World is Orbicular or Round, it
is manifest by the infallible testimony of the
Prophet <hi>David, Psalm 89. The heavens are
thine, the earth also is thine, thou hast laid
the foundation of the round world, and all
they that dwell therein, Psalm</hi> 24. 1. The
Orbicular form that we observe to be in Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
Bodies is to them natural, but accidental
to the Elements: according to that saying,
<hi>Figura Sphaerica in Coelestibus essentialiter,
in Elementis verò accidentaliter. Arist. 1. de
Coelo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Star (which is next to be considered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Heaven) is a permanent and constant
Essence, and the more condensat or compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
part of the Sphere, wherein it is fixed,
for the illuminating of Inferiour Bodies: for
albeit it be an usual distinction, that of Stars
some are fixed, and some are planetary or
wandring, yet they are indeed all fixed alike,
and setled in one certain part of the Sphere,
but in respect of our eye, and in reference of
their motions one of another, they have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
aspect, and so have gotten a diverse
name. It is holden that the fixed Stars are
discerned by their sparkling or twinckling, by
reason that our sight being bound as it were by
the forcibleness of their resplendent rays, our
eyes do become wavering and trembling in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
them; and for this cause ought all
Stars to be made with their rays or points wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
as in Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Now the chiefest, but not the sole end, of the
Creation of Stars, was not alone to give light,
and with their influence to be assisting to the
Sun and Moon, in their procreation, producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and fructification of the Seeds, Sets, Plants,
and Herbs committed to the Earth; but also
to the designation and foreshewing of times
and seasons, like as the Sun and Moon were,
as shall be shewed in place convenient hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
As for Example; The rising of the Star
<hi>Arcturus,</hi> placed near to the Bear, called
<hi>Vrsa Major,</hi> or the greater Bear, denoteth
unto us the presence of the Spring.</p>
               <p>This Star sheweth it self after the expirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Ianuary</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> as a manifest
note of the beginning of the Spring, when the
Sun entreth the sign of <hi>Aries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The rising of the Pleiades or seven Stars doth
demonstrate unto us that the Harvest Season is
at hand; and so forth of others. We may
read hereof <hi>Iob</hi> 38. where he speaketh of
the influence of these and of other Stars.</p>
               <p>The most part of all the Stars are, as it
were, publishers and proclaimers to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
us what we ought to do in each season
concerning the things serving for the use of this
present life.</p>
               <p>Stars are Gods Instruments whereby he
worketh the effects of his Providence in these
Inferiour Bodies; <hi>Instrumento autem utitur
Artifex pro suo Arbitrio;</hi> An Artificer useth
his Tool at his pleasure, and to serve his will.
In vain therefore are the predictions of them
that take upon them to foretell of things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent,
and that shall come to pass in future
time; and will confidently affirm what good
or evil fortune shall befall a man: A thing that
is only known to the secret will of God, and
resteth in his Divine Providence to dispose
thereof at his good pleasure; as appeareth
<hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 24.</p>
               <p>As to the number of points whereof a Star
consisteth, we must observe, they must never
be fewer than six; but when the same is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of more, then must you in blazoning of
them express their certain number: for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
you shall find a Star formed of Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
points, as in this next Example shall
appear.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>The excellency of the Stars is highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
<hi>Eccles.</hi> 43. 9. where speaking of the
glorious beauty of their Order and Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it is said, That it is a Camp pitched on
high, shining in the Firmament of Heaven.
<hi>The beauty of the Heavens are the glorious
Stars, and the Ornament that shineth in the
high places of the Lord. By the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the holy One they continue in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and fail not in their watch.</hi> And the
particular <hi>Stars</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>God calleth
by their names;</hi> as likewise doth patient <hi>Iob</hi>
remember the titles of several Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Stars are sometimes found pierced, and other
whiles charged; for the difference of which
two forms of bearing, you have had a Rule
formerly delivered. Moreover, it is a Rule
infallible, That the piercing of Stars must be
evermore round; for the piercing square, and
Losenge-ways, are repugnant to the nature of
Stars. Here I will give you a general Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
touching bearing of Ordinaries and
common Charges together.

               <p>This General Rule I have thought good to
set down in this place, here being my first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the handling of common Charges,
and where their mixt bearing with Ordinaries
is first mentioned, to the end that the same
may serve as the stern of a Ship to direct your
understanding, touching such interposed bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of any of the common Charges with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries;
because I labour to shun all idle itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and multiplicity of unprofitable Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
tending to one and the same end. This
form of bearing shall you find dispersedly, yet
not confusedly, exemplified in this Work, that
will give approbation to the generality of this
note, which doth not warrant this form of
bearing alone in these, but also generally in
all other Coat-Armours of like kind. Of these
several forms of bearing, I have chosen some
particular Examples, as in these next Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheons,
and others, shall follow in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
places.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>

               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>The Stars may signifie unto us a hopeful
success and happy event, in the turbulent
time of tempestuous flaws and turmoils of this
present life.</p>
               <p>Like as in the Winter season the Stars shine
more clear and resplendent than in the Summer
time; even so is the glory and vertue of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
and magnanimous spirit more evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discerned in a shattered and broken estate,
than in prosperity.</p>
               <p>Whensoever there is a separation of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Charges born in Coat-Armours, by reason
of the Interposition of some of the before
mentioned Ordinaries, then are they not term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Ordinaries, but most worthy Partitions;
and they are such (saith <hi>Leigh</hi>) as though
the common Charge annexed do occupy more
than one point of the Escocheon, yet every
of them is in as great effect as though it were
one only thing, by the reason of Soveraignty
of the same Partition interposed.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given you a taste of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and variable manner of bearing of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries
commixt with common Charges, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the General Rule formerly given.
As for Example, that common Charges are
born with Ordinaries, you may see in the first
and third of these six Escocheons: That they
be born upon Ordinaries, it is manifest by the
second Escocheon: That they are parted by
Ordinaries interposed between them, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by these last Escocheons: That they
are born in form of Ordinaries, or Ordinary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
it is clear by the fourth Escocheon.
Note, that albeit I have here set down but one
Example of each of these particular forms of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55096:48"/>
bearing, yet must you hold that in every of
these several sorts there are divers other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
kinds of composition of Coat-Armours,
as shall appear hereafter at large unto the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Observer. Furthermore, whereas I have
given only two Examples of common Charges
born with Ordinaries, one Example of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
charged upon, one of Ordinaries inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and one of common Charges born Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary-ways,
or in form of Ordinaries; you
must understand by the first sort, all common
Charges whatsoever, born with a Pale, Bend,
Fess, Chevron, or any other of the Ordinaries
before-named in any sort by the second: all
sorts of Ordinaries charged upon, with any
kind of common Charge: by the third, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition
of whatsoever sort of Ordinary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
common Charges. Lastly, by the fourth,
you must understand all sorts of common
Charges born in form, or after the manner of a
Cross, Saltire, Pale, Bend, Fess, or of any other
of the said Ordinaries. These have I here
handled briefly, because I must of necessity deal
more copiously in each particular of them in
places better fitting thereunto.</p>

               <p>THus far of such Stars which we called
fixed: Now of those Planets whose
shapes are of most use in Heraldry; I
mean those two glorious Lights, the one for
the Day, the other for the Night: for, as for
the other <hi>five Planets,</hi> because their aspect is
less to the view, therefore they cannot easily
admit a different form from the fixed
Stars. The Sun is the very fountain of Light,
and (as some Philosophers think) of Heat
also; and all the splendor which the Moon hath,
it borroweth from the Sun, and therefore as
the Sun goeth farther off, or nearer to her, so
her light doth increase or diminish. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
both these and the Stars there is a great
conformity, in respect of their sparkling and
resplendent beams, which are in appearance
more evident, and in operation more effectual,
or at least more palpably discerned in these, by
reason of their nearness unto us, than of those
that are from us so far remote. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are unlike, that the beautiful and
blazing brightness of these is oftentimes sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the passion of darkning or eclipsing.
Of whose glistering, eclipsing, and variety
of forms, we have bearing, these and other
like Examples following.</p>
               <figure/>

               <figure/>
               <p>Which occasioned a witty Moral related by
<hi>Plutarch</hi> (as I think) how on a time the
Moon sent for a Taylor to make her a Gown,
but he could never fit her, for it was either
too little, or too big for her; which was not
the Taylors fault, but her own inconstancy:
so impossible a thing it is to fit the humours of
one that is fickle and unstable.</p>
               <p>Sometimes you shall find all these several
kinds of Lights before expressed, born toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one Escocheon; as in Example.</p>

day we take no notice of any other form, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the increasing or decreasing Moon, but
only of this depraved shape, which corrupt
Custom hath rashly hatched, as a form much
differing from those before exemplified, if not
meerly repugnant to nature. The Patricians
of <hi>Rome</hi> used to wear the Badge of the Moon
on their shoes: as these Cressants are, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the sole Charge of the Field, as in this
Escocheon, so they are born upon, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the honourable Ordinaries, as in these

such as are Inconstant Natures, so far forth as

the bearing of simple Essences, or (at
the least) of such things as have a
mutual participation of qualities with them;
I will now proceed to the handling of the next
Member of the Distribution, which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
Essences, or Natures of mixt Kinds.</p>

               </p>
               <p>By Brute Natures I understand all Essences
whatsoever of mixt kind that are meerly void
of life. Such are <hi>Meteors,</hi> which are unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
kinds of mixture, which by their strange
Apparitions do move their Beholders to an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
and these are called <hi>Corpora subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi>
because they are ingendred aloft in the
Airy Region. The matter whereof these
Meteors are ingendred, is a certain attracted
fume drawn up on high by the Operation of
the Sun and Stars.</p>
               <p>This fume or smoak is <list>
                     <item>Vapour.</item>

               </p>
               <p>Vapour is a moist kind of fume extracted
chiefly out of the Water, and therefore is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
dissolved again thereinto, and hence are
watry Meteors.</p>
               <p>Exhalation is a drier kind of fume, attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up from the Earth, and apt to be inflamed,
and they are firy Meteors. There are also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Meteors formed of a mixture of both these
fumes.</p>
               <p>Firy Meteors are forms consisting of hot Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations

a hot quality, which at length breaketh

               <p>Simple firy Meteors are of divers sorts and
different forms, whereof there is little use in
Coat-Armour, except of the falling Star,
which of Blazoners is termed a Mullet; which
is an Exhalation inflamed above in the Air,
and stricken back with a Cloud, whereby it is
forced to run downwards in such sort, that
to the Ignorant a Star seemeth to fall. There
is oftentimes found upon the Earth a certain
gelly fallen from above, and dispersed into
divers points, which of many is taken to be
the substance of the Falling Star or Mullet.
Note that such Mullets born in Coat-Armour,
are now most usual of five points, but ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
you shall find them born of six points.</p>
               <p>And so I have seen them in divers very old
Rolls, in the Custody of that worthy Knight,
Sir <hi>Richard Saint George,</hi> now <hi>Clarencieux</hi>

of the inconstancy of high Fortunes, and
unsure footing of ambitious Aspirers, which
may shine for a time, but in a moment fall
headlong from the Heaven of their high hopes;
yet the Mullet in Heraldry hath a more noble
signification, it being supposed to represent
some Divine quality bestowed from above,
whereby men do shine in Vertue, Learning,
and works of Piety, like bright Stars on the
Earth; and these are <hi>Stellae dimissae è Coelo,</hi>
Stars let down from Heaven by God; not <hi>Stel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae

Tayl of the Dragon threw down, which are
Apostates from God and their Religion; nor
yet <hi>Cadentes stellae,</hi> falling Stars, such as the

down from the height of their Honours.</p>

               <p>So much of simple firy Meteors, so far forth
as there is use of them in Coat-Armour: Now
of such Meteors as are of mixt kind, according
to the distribution before delivered in the next
president. These are firy Meteors bred of an
Exhalation somewhat more gross and impure,
than those before specified, by reason of a more
thick and slimy vapour whereof they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred.</p>
               <p>Meteors of this kind are <list>
                     <item>Thunder.</item>
                     <item>Lightning.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Thunder is an inflamed Exhalation, which
by his powerful force breaketh thorow the
Clouds violently, with great noise and terror.
The forcible power thereof is rather appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
by the ear, than subjected to the sight:
nevertheless, the ancient times have devised a
certain imaginary form whereby they would
express the forcible power thereof, as also of
the Lightning.</p>
               <p>Thunder is supposed to be ingendred two
manner of ways, <hi>viz.</hi> when either a hot or dry
vapour is inclosed in a cold and moist Cloud,
and being unable to contain it self therein, by
reason of the contrariety, it laboureth by all
means to find a vent, and so striving by all
means to get passage, it maketh way with
great vehemency and horror of sound: such
as a glowing Gad of Iron, or any other firy
matter maketh, when water is infused there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
in abundance, or that it is therein drench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it maketh a furious and murmuring sound.
Such is that weak and feeble sort of Thunder,
that seemeth to be ingendred in some Region
of the Air far remote from us, yielding only
(for a small time) a kind of turbulent noise or
murmuring.</p>
               <p>Or else it is ingendred in a more violent
manner, to wit, when this inclosed dry and
combustible matter, being in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lamed in the
Clouds of contrary qualities, doth break out
with vehemency, then doth it yield a terrible
and forcible sound, not unlike a great piece of
Ordnance when it is overcharged. And this
sound, thus ingendred, is called <hi>Thunder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This sort of sound is used oftentimes Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically,
as when God threatneth his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against Sin, he is said to thunder them
out. In this sense doth <hi>Petrarch</hi> use the same,
saying, <hi>Deus ideo tonat in Coelis, ut tu in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras
bene vivas, quodque amoxe debueras, sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
metu facias.</hi> For unless God loved man,
he would never threaten him, but rather pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
him; forasmuch as man doth evermore
minister many and those grievous occasions of
execution of Gods Judgments.</p>
               <p>Lightning is a vehement <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ruption of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
Exhalation, proceeding from Thunder;
which though it is in time after the Thunder,
yet is first represented to our senses, by reason
that our sight is far more subtil and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
than is our hearing. And in regard that
Thunder and Lightning do both proceed from
one self cause, they have in such their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
fiction conjoyned them both under one
form, after this manner.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>His Inference had been truer thus:
<q>
                     <l>If God should Thunder-strike still when he sin
doth see,</l>
                     <l>All men would soon be spent, yet God still arm'd
should be.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto of Firy Meteors; now of such as
be watry.</p>
               <p>Watry Meteors are certain cold and moist
Vapours, copiously attracted by the powerful
operation of the Heavenly Bodies into the Air,
and there transmutated into their several
forms. Of these there are divers sorts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Clouds are most usually born in Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
               <p>A Cloud is a gross Vapour, attracted into
the middle Region of the Air, and there thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
by reason of the coldness of the place,
having in it store of matter apt to ingender
water. A Cloud (according to <hi>Zanchius</hi>)
is a moist thick Vapour, attracted from the
waters by the heat of the Sun, unto the middle
Region of the Air, and there thickned by the
coldness thereof, and so continueth until it be
again dissolved by the Suns heat, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into rain, and doth distill down in
drops. <hi>Zanch. de Meteoris aqueis,</hi> 483. The
Clouds are said to be Gods Chariots, as we may
see <hi>Psalm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 104. He layeth the beams of his
Chambers in the waters, and maketh the
Clouds his Chariot, and walketh upon the wings
of the winds.</hi> The Clouds are Gods Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
wherein he containeth and retaineth at
his pleasure, the shours of Rain, as in Bottles:
as we may see <hi>Iob 38. 37. Who can number the
Clouds by wisdom? Or who can cease the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
of Heaven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Clouds are resembled to a Spunge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished
with water, and God with the hand
of his Providence wringeth the Spunge mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
not pressing out all the moisture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
at once, but leasurely, and by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
after a gentle and soaking manner. No
Pencil can make a true representation of
Clouds, because every instant and moment of
time, doth add unto them some kind of alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
whereby it differeth from that it was
late before: nevertheless, former times have
coyned (of these also) a conceited form, as in
these next Escocheons may be seen.</p>

Residence; and therefore next let us cast
our eyes on it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <p>HItherto have we prosecuted our intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
touching things of mixt nature,
which are brute or liveless: Now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
we to the consideration of things of mixt
Nature, having life. Mixt Natures that are
living, are Corporeal Essences, endued with
a Vegetable Soul: for here we use this word
Soul, as also the word Life, in his largest
signification. A Vegetable Soul is a faculty or
power that giveth life unto Bodies.</p>
               <p>Whereby they do live After a sort,
or,
Perfectly.</p>
               <p>Such as do live after a sort, or less perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
are all sorts of Mettals; which because they
are supposed to grow and increase in the Earth,
we will (for our present use) ascribe life unto
them.</p>
               <p>Mettals are Bodies imperfectly living, and are
decocted in the Veins of the Earth.</p>
               <p>Of these some are naturally <list>
                     <item>Liquefiable.</item>
                     <item>Not Liquefiable, or less Liquefiable.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The Liquefiable are Gold, Silver, Copper,
Tin, Lead, and other of like kind.</p>
               <p>The not or hardly Liquefiable are <list>

               </p>
               <p>Those that are altogether hard, are Stones
of all sorts. Stones are bred of a waterish
moisture, and of an oily kind of Earth firmly
compacted together.</p>
               <p>Of Stones, some are <list>
                     <item>Precious.</item>
                     <item>Base.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Stones precious are of that sort that we call
in Latin <hi>Gemmae;</hi> which are of estimation either
for that they are rarely to be gotten, or for
some vertue phansied to be in them, or for that
they are such as wherewith mans Eye is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
delighted by reason of their pureness
and beautiful transparent substance. Of which
kind are the Diamond, Topaz, Escarbuncle, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merald,
Ruby, and such like. Of which sorts,
twelve of chiefest note were appointed by
God himself to be used in the principal Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the High Priest, when he appeared
before the Lord, presenting therein the Names
of the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> to shew how
precious in his sight is the People and Nation
which serveth him, as himself prescribeth.
But of all these several kinds, the Escarbuncle is
of most use in Arms, and is born as in these
next Escocheons appeareth.</p>

               <p>So much of precious Stones: now of those
which are Base; such we esteem all those to
be, which both for their ordinary and base
imployments, and also for that they are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
to be had of all men, are of small esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
as are these next following, with
their like.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>So much of Mettals or Minerals (for I use the
word in the largest sense) that are hard and
not liquefiable; there are other also which we
reckoned to be hardly liquefiable, in respect of
their brittle nature; such are Alom, Salt, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Chalk, &amp;c. but there is no use of them in
Arms. Because in this Chapter I have spoken
of precious Stones, divers of which are of use
in Heraldry, for blazoning of the Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of Nobility (as my self have often occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to do in sundry parts of this Work:) before
I proceed further, I will set down those seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Stones, as they answer to their several
Mettals and Colours; together with the Planets
also, which I use only in the Atchievements of
Kings and great Princes.

               <p>SO much touching Examples of such Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
as do live after a sort: In the next
place succeed those things, which do live
perfectly or properly; such Natures are those
as have in them express and manifest tokens of
a living Soul.</p>
               <p>Of this kind, some are
 <list>
                     <item>Vegetable.</item>
                     <item>Sensitive.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Forasmuch as I am now to treat of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Animals, and of their particular kinds; I
must excuse my self in two things before I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the exemplifying of them: The one,
that there is no cause that any man should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
at my hands an express demonstration of
each particular Species of them; and that I
should run through and display their manifold
and almost innumerable kinds, for that would
be a tedious travel, and (besides) an infinite
and unnecessary charge and cost, and withal
far wide from the project of my prefixed pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
The other thing (and the same more
pertinent to that I do intend) is, That in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Vegetables and Sensitives, I purpose
only to distribute their several ranks of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution,
according to their Order to them
prescribed by Nature, which to express is my
chiefest drift, and the principal scope that I
do aim at.</p>
               <p>Of the perfect sort of Creatures there are
many kinds, whereof some are of more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and more worthy than others, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their more excellent kind of life, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
of soul.</p>
               <p>Of these the less perfect sort of Bodies were
first created; and then such as were of more
perfection. Plants are more worthy than Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
and Animals of more reckoning than
Plants: therefore were these first created, and
those afterwards.</p>
               <p>Of Animals wherewith God did adorn the
Air, the Waters, and the Earth, there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
kinds, whereof some were more worthy
than others; in the Creation of these did God
observe the same order.</p>
               <p>Between the Creation of Plants and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
it pleased God in his unsearchable wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to interpose the creation of the Stars
wherewith he beautified the Heavens, he did
it to this end, to give us to understand, That
albeit the Sun with his light and motion, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Stars, do concur in the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Plants and Animals, nevertheless their
Generation is not to be attributed simply to the
influence and power of these Celestial Bodies;
but only to the Omnipotency of God, inasmuch
as by his powerful Word he commanded the
Earth to produce all sorts of Plants and their
Fruits, before the Stars were created.</p>
               <p>From the most fertile and pleasant Garden of
<hi>Eden,</hi> unto the most barren and desolate Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
may we see and behold the great and
wonderful works of God, and take occasion
to extol his Omnipotency, Wisdom, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
As we may observe <hi>Isai. 41. 9. I will set in the
Wilderness the Cedar, the Shittah tree, and the
Myrhe tree, and the Pine tree; and I will set in
the Wilderness the Firr tree, the Elm, and the
Box together. Therefore let them see, and know,
and let them consider and understand together,
that the hand of the Lord hath done this, and
that the holy One of Israel hath created it, v.</hi> 20.
Hence we may gather that there is no object
so mean that presenteth it self to our view,
but will minister some just occasion to glorifie
God.</p>
               <p>Men are accustomed to attribute the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of these, either to the influence of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or to the travel and industry of man;
but these were produced before any other of
like kind could be found upon the face of the
Earth, whereof it might be imagined they
might receive being; for as yet there had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fallen any rain to fructifie the Earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it might produce green herbs, nor as yet
was Man created, that might manure and till
the Ground for that purpose: therefore neither
were they produced naturally, or of their own
accord, nor yet by the Art, Skill, or Industry
of Man, but by the immediate Word and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of God.</p>
               <p>The reason that moved <hi>Moses</hi> to give an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Plants and Herbs, how that they
were produced by the vertue and power of
Gods Word only, and not naturally, or by the
skill and industry of man; neither yet of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
nor of any other of the infinite number
of things created (<hi>Genes.</hi> 1. 11.) was this,
because the Generation of Plants and Herbs
might be much more doubted of, than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
of other things.</p>
               <p>Of the first springing of Trees in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>Et germinare fecerat Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va
Elohim è terra omnem arborem concupisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilem,
id est, visu, &amp; bonam ad escam;</hi> which
words do comprehend all the desirable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Fruit trees: for in them we expect that
their fruits should be either delightful to the
Eye, or that they should be fit for food and
wholsom, and that they be also fragrant and
sweet smelling: For the fruits of Trees, the
better they be, the more odoriferous they
are.</p>
               <p>That the Trees wherewith Paradise was
planted, had all these qualities, it is manifest
by the words of <hi>Moses,</hi> in that he saith, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscibilem
ad visum, &amp; bonam ad escam:</hi>
whereby we gather that the sight is delighted
with things beautiful and glorious, the smell
with sweet and pleasant savours, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
with things of sweet and pleasant taste.
And none of these are in themselves evil; for
such was the constitution of <hi>Adam</hi> before he
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55096:55"/>
transgressed, that he might have delighted
himself in them all without offence; and to
that end did God create them, that he should
use them with thanksgiving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> describeth unto us two principal qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of the Garden of <hi>Paradise,</hi> whereby he
laieth before us the pleasantness of the situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof, and also the beauty and fertility
of the soil. The first of these qualities was,
that it was replenished with all sorts of Trees,
not only most pleasant and delightful to the
eye, but also most pleasant to the taste; for
that they produced the best and sweetest fruits:
The other quality was, that the whole cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
of the Garden of <hi>Paradise</hi> was
surrounded and invironed with a River, being
distributed into four heads, which did highly
beautifie the same, and made it most pleasant
to the view.</p>
               <p>In this discription <hi>Moses</hi> maketh mention of
two Trees of special qualities, that were plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the midst of <hi>Paradise:</hi> The one named
the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> the other the <hi>Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of good and evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first of these had a vivificant power in
it self, the fruit whereof was ordained to this
end; That being eaten, it would enable a man
never to feel sickness, feebleness, old age, or
death, but should evermore continue in the
same state of strength and agility of body:
This was the efficacy and power that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to this Tree, whereof it was never yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived:
Therefore was this quality after a sort
natural thereunto.</p>
               <p>For this cause was there a Cherub set at the
entrance of <hi>Paradise,</hi> to keep out such as
would enter the same, and eat of the fruit of
the Tree of Life; that he should not always
live that kind of life.</p>
               <p>How behooful the knowledge of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and operations of Trees, Plants, Herbs,
and other Vegetables are, for the extolling and
manifesting the Omnipotency, Wisdom, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
loving favour and fatherly providence of
our most gracious God towards sinful man is,
in that he hath created for the behoof and use
of man, as well touching his necessary food
and raiment, as for recreation and delight,
we may evidently perceive by <hi>Solomon</hi>'s indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
investigation of the vertues and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of all sorts of Vegetables: For (besides
other his admirable qualities wherewith he
was richly endued) he had surpassing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the vertues, operations and qualities
of Herbs and other Vegetables; insomuch that
he was able to reason, discourse and dispute,
not only of Beasts, Fowls, creeping things
and Fishes, but of Trees also and Plants, from
the Cedar in <hi>Lebanon</hi> to the Hyssop that
springeth out of the wall, that is, from the
highest and tallest Tree to the smallest Shrub
and lowest Herb. Thus we see the knowledge
and skill in natural Philosophy to be holden in
great estimation in all Ages, insomuch as it
hath been reckoned a study well befitting the
dignity of a King, yea, of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was
the wisest King that ever was, and a Type of
our Saviour Christ. But to return to the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable.</p>
               <p>Such are said to be Vegetable, as have in
them a lively power of growing, budding,
leafing, blossoming and fructifying, as Trees,
Plants, Herbs, Grass, &amp;c. And of these some
grow on Trunks or solid Bodies, some upon
flexible Stalks: some again grow upon a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Stem, as commonly all Trees do; some up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
manifold Stems, as Shrubs, Roses, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Trees are certain Plants springing from a
root with a single Trunk or Stem (for the
most part) shooting up in height, and delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with lims, sprigs or branches. Of these
Trees some are more proper to hot Countries;
as the Frankinsence Tree to <hi>Arabia;</hi> the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samum,
Myrrhe, Mace and Nutmeg Trees, as
also the Pepper Trees, and such like, which
chiefly grow in <hi>India;</hi> the Plane Tree in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>
and <hi>Arabia;</hi> the Pomegranate in <hi>Africa,</hi>
&amp;c. which I purposely pass over, and will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give Examples of other sorts to us better
known, whether they be Trees fruitful or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren.
In giving Examples whereof I purpose
not to observe any precise order, but to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
them pel mel one with another, because I
hold such curious sorting them, better fitting a
professor of Physick, or some Herbalist, than
an Armorist; to whom it sufficeth to shew su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially,
that these, and their several parts,
are born in Coat-Armour, as well simply of
themselves, as also with things of different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
as in the Examples following may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>

or spring any more.</p>

               <p>Concerning the fruits of Trees, God in the
beginning gave unto man a free scope to use
them without restraint, only the fruit of the
<hi>Tree of Knowledge of good and evil</hi> excepted,
whereof he was prohibited the eating upon
pain to <hi>die the Death</hi> whensoever he should
taste thereof. In this prohibition God would,
that we should not so much respect the fruit of
the Tree, as the Soveraign Authority of him
that forbade the eating thereof; yea, this
chiefly and principally first; and secondly the
fruit, because of the interdiction.</p>
               <p>The end for which God did prohibit <hi>Adam</hi>
the eating of the fruit of the <hi>Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of good and evil</hi> was, that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God had given him a Sovereign Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on earth, yet was he not so absolute a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
and Commander, but that he had a
Lord Paramount, to whose hests he was sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
and withal reverence to obey; and that he
should know that God, his Creator, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
him, whose will should be unto him the
Rule of all Justice, and whereunto he should
conform all his actions, counsels, and cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
that he should evermore have an awful
eye unto him, and always hope in him, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
fear, reverence, and love him. The end
I say was this, That <hi>Adam</hi> should know both
God, and himself: God as his true Creator,
himself to be his Creature; God to be his Lord,
himself his Servant; God a most bountiful and
magnificent giver of all good blessings, himself
God's Foster-child, and such a one as must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that whatsoever he possesseth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
from God's free bounty and mercy;
and therefore should render unto him continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
praise and thanks for the same, from the
ground and bottom of his heart.</p>

               <p>HAving hitherto handled that part of our
distribution which comprehendeth
things Vegetable, proceed we now to
the other concerning things sensitive, which
are all sorts of Animals or Creatures indued
with senses. The senses, as likewise the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Soul, are things in themselves not visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and therefore estranged from the Herald's
uses: But because they reside in bodies of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
parts and qualities from any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned;
therefore in handling of these
sensitive Creatures, I hold it requisite to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with their parts (for of them the whole is
raised;) and these are either the parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
or containing, or sustaining.</p>
               <p>But since we are now to speak of things sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
(and amongst them) first of Terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Animals and their parts, it shall not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
to produce some few causes amongst
many, why these Terrestrial Animals and Man
were created in one day, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>sixth day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, because God had appointed the Earth
to be the joint habitation of man and beast to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
Secondly, in respect of the near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance,
both of bodily parts and natural
properties, that these Terrestrials have of
Man, in respect either of Fowls or of Fishes.
Lastly, for that very many of them were to serve
for man's ease and necessary use: As Oxen to till
the ground; Horses for his ease in travel; Dogs
to be watchful keepers of his house; and others
for other his necessary and Domestical uses.</p>
               <p>There is no Animal but hath at the least
these parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Head, wherewithal to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
food, and wherein their senses have their
residence; a Belly, to receive and concoct his
meat; Intrails, whereby to eject the superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities
or excrements of aliment; Members also,
serving for the use and exercise of the senses,
and others ordained for motion from place to
place; for without these Members he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
receive food or nutriment, neither feel
nor move: Therefore there is neither labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55096:63"/>
beast, or beast of savage kind, domestical
reptiles, or other, that can be without these
bodily parts.</p>
               <p>By the name of Soul and Life, wherewith
all sorts of Animals are endued from God, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
teacheth us, that there is no living creature
to be found that hath not either true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
blood, or at the least some kind of hot
humour that is to it instead of blood; <hi>Anima
enim cujusque Animalis in Sanguine est,</hi> as
<hi>Moses</hi> teacheth <hi>Leviticus</hi> 17. and in sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places; and in the common received o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of all men, <hi>In humido &amp; calido consistit
vita.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which is spoken of divers kinds of <hi>Insecta,</hi>
that there is no blood to be found in them, it is
to be understood to be meant of true, perfect,
and natural blood; but of necessity they must
have instead thereof some kind of humour in
them that hath the quality of blood, <hi>viz.</hi> that
is both hot and moist as afaresaid, else can they
not live.</p>
               <p>Concerning Animals in general, it is not to
be doubted, but that all sorts of them, as well
those of savage and ravenous kind, as those of
domestical and labouring kind, as also venom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Serpents, of themselves, and of their own
nature, were themselves good, and might be
good to others, and profitable for man's use;
for asmuch as it is said, <hi>Et vidit Elohim quod
bonum:</hi> But in that they are now become noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and painful to man, that is <hi>per Accidens;</hi>
for this is occasioned by the sin and transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of man, whereby all things became accursed
for his sake.</p>
               <p>The utility or benefit that cometh to man
by these Terrestrial Animals is twofold; the
one pertaining to the Body, the other to the
Soul. The corporal benefit that cometh to
man by them, who knoweth not? For daily
experience sheweth us how beneficial the use of
horses, oxen, kine, calves, sheep, and other
sorts of beast and cattel of all sorts, are for the
service of man; whereof some serve us for
food, some for raiment, some for carriage,
some for tillage, and other for divers other uses.
Of this use of them <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>That God
hath subjected all things to man, Omnia sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecisti
sub pedibus ejus, &amp;c.</hi> and made him
Ruler over the fishes of the Sea, the fowls of
the Air, and the beasts of the Land; whereby
he giveth us to understand, That all sorts of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
were created for the divers uses of man,
and each one of them ordained to a several
end. But their spiritual use is farr more noble
and excellent, by how much the soul surpasseth
the body in dignity and worthiness.</p>
               <p>And their use consisteth not alone in this,
that by the consideration of them we are led
to the knowledge of God, and of his wisdom,
power and goodness (for this use have all things
else that are created) as appeareth <hi>Romans</hi> 1.
and elsewhere: But also that in these Animals
God hath proposed to us such notable examples
of imitation, in respect of vices to be eschew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that, the sacred Scriptures excepted, there
is no moral Precepts can better instruct us than
these Animals do, which are daily in our view,
and of which we have daily use: amongst these
we may produce some examples of fishes and
fowls, but many more may we gather from
Terrestrial Animals. And to the end we should
shun the ignorance of things, such especially
as are Celestial, <hi>David,</hi> the Kingly Prophet,
proposeth to us for examples, the Horse and
Mule saying, <hi>Non eritis sicut Equus &amp; Mulus,
in quibus non est intellectus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Like as Natural Philosophy consisteth in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, so doth it chiefly in the knowledge
of Animals, <hi>viz.</hi> in the understanding of their
wisdome, natures and properties: which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
hath been approved by God himself from
the beginning; and not only approved, but
also ordained and given to <hi>Adam;</hi> for <hi>Moses</hi>
saith, God brought these Animals unto <hi>Adam,</hi>
to the end that he should advisedly view and
consider them; to the end that <hi>Adam</hi> should
give them names answerable to their shapes,
natures, proportion, and qualities; and that
the imposition of these names should not be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
or at adventure (for God abhorreth all
disorder and confusion) but deliberately and
according to reason, so as every thing might
be aptly distinguished from other, by their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
names, and according to their several
natures and dispositions; and that for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
that we hearing their names, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
their significations may be led to
the understanding of their natural properties,
for which Etymology, or true interpretation
and derivation of words is very behoofful and
of great use.</p>
               <p>The parts contained are Humours and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
whereof only the first is used in Coat-Armours,
wherein are represented sometimes
drops of blood, and sometimes tears, which
both are naturally humours contained, though
in Armory they are supposed no longer to be
contained, but shed forth. The bearing of
this humour, blood, is understood to be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
born Drop-meale (as I may so term it)
or by drops. Which manner of bearing is in
blazon termed Gutte, of the Latin word <hi>Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
which signifieth a drop of any thing that
is either by Nature liquid, or liquefied by Art.
These drops do receive a different manner of
blazon, according unto their different colour,
or diversity of the substance whereof they do
consist, as by Examples shall appear.</p>

               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>In blazoning of Coat-Armours charged with
drops, you must evermore consider the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
whereof they are, and to give them a
denomination accordingly, so shall you not
need to name their colour at all; forasmuch as
by their substance their colours are easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
whereof I will give you some few Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in these Escocheons next following;
which albeit they may seem to be unduly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed with these, yet in respect of their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form manner of bearing, to wit, by drops (as
the former) I have chosen rather to sort them
together with these, than to bestow them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly
under several Heads.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>Note, that if such kind of drops be Or, then
shall they be taken as representations of fusible
or liquid Gold: if they be Vert, then shall they
be taken to be drops of Oyl-olive, as hereafter
shall appear, when I shall speak of Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
whose fields have no tincture predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating.
But to return to the humour of blood
(from which we have upon occasion hitherto
digressed) it is infallible that there is no Animal
or living Creature but hath in it either blood,
or some other kind of hot humour in quality
like thereunto, as I have said before.</p>
               <p>These humours beforementioned, in respect
of their moist and fluent nature, do stand in
need of some other thing to contain them; and
such containing parts are either the outmost
includer, which is the skin (of which we have
already spoken in the first Section, where we
treated of Furrs) or the whole Body it self,
with the several members and parts thereof;
all which, because they need their supporters,
those we will first speak of, and so descend unto
the whole bearings and parts.</p>
               <p>But I will first shew you an Example of the
bearing of dead mens sculls, and then proceed
to the supporting parts.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Parts of support, whereof we have use in
Arms, are those solid substances which sustain
the Body, <hi>viz.</hi> the Bones, whereby the Body
is not only underpropped, but also carried
from place to place, by help of their ligatures
and sinews. Of the use of these in Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
you shall have Examples in these Esco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheons
next following.</p>

               <p>IN following the tract which our method
first chalked out unto us, we are at length
come to such blazons, as do present to the
eyes those sensitive things which we called the
Containing, because they are the mansion, in
which not only the blood and spirits, but also
the bones (which we named the parts sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
are inclosed. These are Animals or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Creatures, with their parts and members.
An Animal is any substance consisting both of
a body fitted for divers functions, and of a soul
giving life, sense, and motion.</p>
               <p>Animals (saith <hi>Zanchius</hi>) especially such
as do produce a living creature, have a more
near resemblance of man, both as touching the
parts of their bodies, as also concerning the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of their mind, and subtilty and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of wit; for their bodies also do consist
(like as ours do) of flesh, sinews, arteries,
bones, gri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tles and skin, &amp;c. In like sort they
have head, neck, breasts, back, a chine or
backbone, thighs, legs and feet: As also
hearts, lights, liver, spleen, guts, and other
inward parts as we have: Furthermore, they
do participate with us in our actions, as to eat,
drink, sleep, watch and move: albeit in many
other things they are much unlike us.</p>
               <p>In the handling of Animals, it might be a
scruple, whether the bearing of such creatures
whole should have precedence in their bearing
before their parts, and also in what rank and
order the several kinds of creatures are to be
marshalled by us, that thereby the dignity of
their bearing may be best conceived; because
the dignity of those things that are born in
Coat-Armour, being truly known, and duly
considered, doth not a little illustrate the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
of the bearers in the displaying of their
Ensigns. For taking away these scruples, I
hold it requisite, before I proceed to give Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
first to set down certain notes by way
of introduction to that which followeth, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how the dignity of these Animals, hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be handled, is to be accounted of, either
in a relative respect of things of distinct Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
compared one to another, or in a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
reference of Animals of the same kind
each to other.</p>
               <p>This dignity cannot be better understood,
than by taking a considerate view of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which the Author of all Order, and the
most wise and powerful Disposer of all things,
did observe, not only in the creation of the
Celestial, but also of the Elementary parts of
the World, with their several Ornaments,
wherein be observed a continual progression
from things of less perfection, to things more
perfect. For, was there not a Chaos <hi>without
from and void,</hi> before it came to that admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
beauty, whereof it is said, <hi>Loe, it was very
good?</hi> In the Celestial, the Sun (the glory
thereof) was made after the Firmament, and
the Night was before the Day. In the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
bodies, the Vegetables, as Trees, were made
before sensitive and living Creatures: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
these, the Fishes (which have neither
breath nor voice, and therefore imperfecter)
were before the Fowls, and both of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
terrestrial creatures; and all of all sorts
before man, made after God's Image, for
whose service all other things were made, as he
was made for God's Service. Moreover, in the
creation of man, the body was before the soul,
which yet is a thing incomparably of more
perfection.</p>
               <p>By this rude draught of God and Natures
admirable method, you may conceive the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
dignity of those creatures, as often as they
shall occur in Armory. But as Art hath not
always the same end which nature hath (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the one intendeth the being, the other
the knowing of things:) so is not the method
of both always alike in attaining their ends;
for Natures process is <hi>à simplicibus ad composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
from the single parts to the whole, whereas
Art descendeth from the compounds to the
simples: in imitation whereof, we shall in this
our progress follow this course, that first every
whole bearing of any Animal shall precede,
and then such parts and members thereof as u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
are born; for so every one that first hath
seen the whole, will discern the parts the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
whereas he that seeth a part (having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seen the whole) knoweth not whereof it
is a part. And in Coat-Armour the whole
bearing of Animals is most worthy, yet is not
the bearing of parts to be misliked; but if we
consider both the one and the other respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then doth the whole bearing farr surmount
the parts in honour and dignity.</p>
               <p>Neither must we here precisely esteem the
worth of every bearing by this order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
because Art doth sometimes stamp a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
note of dignity, for some particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
as for some especial use, quality, or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the things. And this dignity or nobility
may have a twofold relation; the one, betwixt
Animals of divers kinds, as a Lion and a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,
a Woolf and a Lamb; the other, betwixt
things of one kind, as whelps of one litter,
whereof yet one may be nobler than the other,
as the one will run to the Chase, the other to
the Pottage Pot. And forasmuch as the living
things beforementioned, as well vegetable as
sensitive, have their peculiar vertues worthy
imitation, as also their particular vices to be
eschewed, and that it is a chief glory to Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of Coat-Armonr, to have their vertues
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55096:65"/>
displaied under the types and forms of such
things as they bear, it is to be wished that each
one of them would considerately examin the
commendable properties of such significant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
as they do bear, and do his best to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festto
the world, that he hath the like in himself:
for it is rather a dishonour than a praise for a
man to bear a Lion on his shield, if he bear a
Sheep in his heart, or a Goofe in his brain;
being therein like those Ships, which bear the
names of Dreadnought, Victory, and the like,
though sometimes it speed with them contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to their Titles. A true generous mind will
endeavour that for his self-vertues, he may
be esteemed, and not insist only upon the fame
and merits of his Progenitours, the praise
whereof is due to them, and not to him.</p>

               <p>And now we will proceed to some particular
precepts, concerning things sensitive born in
Coat-Armour. Wherein first observe, that
all sorts of Animals born in Arms or Ensigns,
must in blazoning be interpreted in the best
sense, that is, according to their most generous
and noble qualities, and so to the greatest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of their bearers. For example; the Fox
is full of wit, and withal given wholly to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for his prey; if then this be the charge of
an Escocheon, we must conceive the quality re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented,
to be his wit and cunning, but not
his pilfering and stealing, and so of all other.
All Beasts of savage and fierce nature, must be
figured and set forth in their most noble and
fierce action; as a Lion erected bolt upright,
his mouth wide open, his claws extended (as
if he were prepared to rent and tear;) for with
his teeth and claws he doth exercise his fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
in this form he is said to possess his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor
and courage; and being thus formed, he
is said to be rampant. Action doth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>David</hi> approve to be proper to a Lion,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 22. where describing the crueltie of the
wicked towards him, he saith, <hi>They raged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me with their mouths, as it were a ramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and roaring Lion.</hi> A Leopard or Wolf
must be pourtraied going (as it were) <hi>Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentim,</hi>
step by step; which form of action
(saith <hi>Chassanaeus</hi>) fitteth their natural disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and is termed Passant: All sorts of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
or gentle nature, must be set forth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the most noble and kindly action of
every of them, as a Horse running or vaulting,
a Greyhound coursing, a Deer tripping, a Lamb
going with a smooth and easie pace, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And concerning the true placing of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
of whatsoever kinds in Armory according
to Order, Art, and the Property of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
the use of the thing, whereupon they are
to be placed or depicted, must be first consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of, and so must they be placed accordingly,
whether they be born bolt upright, passant, or
tripping, or howsoever.</p>
               <p>As if they be to be placed in Banners, they
must be so placed, as that it be agreeable to the
natural quality of the thing that is born, <hi>Ars
enim imitatur naturam in quantum potest:</hi>
therefore since it is proper for a Banner to be
carried upon a staff, according to the use there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the staff doth proceed, and the Banner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
after; therefore ought the face to look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the staff, that is, directly forwards. So
is it likewise in every other thing, whose parts
are distinguished <hi>per Ante &amp; Post;</hi> in such the
forepart of the thing born shall be placed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the staff, otherwise it would seem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trograde
or going backwards, which were mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
to behold.</p>
               <p>If a man do bear only the head of some A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
(then most commonly) the forepart
thereof cannot aptly regard the staff, but is
born sideways chiefly being full faced, whether
it be the head of Ram, Bull, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As touching the orderly placing of the feet
of Animals, this is a general Rule, That the
right foot must be placed formost, <hi>Quia dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
pars est principium motus.</hi> And withal, it
is the most noble part in regard it is the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and more active, and therefore thus to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
them, is to set them forth in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendablest
fashion; for <hi>Dispositio laudatissima
animalis est, ut in omnibus dispositionibus suis
sit secundum cursum naturae;</hi> that is the best
disposition of every creature, which is most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable
to nature.</p>
               <p>But here you must observe, That in a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that which is made for the one side, will
seem to be the left foot on the contrary side,
but that chanceth by accident: and therefore
the side next to him that beareth the Banner
must be chiefly respected, that the same be
formed right in regard of him; like as it is in
writing, that side next to the writer is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to order; whereas if we turn the paper,
all falleth out after a preposterous fashion:
Therefore we must chiefly respect the side next
the bearer, let the rest fall out as it shall.</p>
               <p>Arms are sometimes depicted or embroider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Garments of men, and chiefly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the uppermost vesture of Military persons,
especially Emperors, Kings, and their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
and other Commanders in Military Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
used to cast over their Armours a kind of
short habit, as a Jacket, Mandylian, or such
like, whereupon their Arms were richly beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
and curiously wrought; to the end, that
in time of service, their Souldiers, who could
not be directed by the ear (by reason of the
far distance that was oftentimes upon occasion
between them and their Commander) they
might by their eye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> instructed according to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55096:65"/>
the necessity of the present service, and might
by ocular observation of their Commander
(being so eminently clad) know and discern
their fit times and opportunities of marching,
making a stand, assailing, retiring, and other
their like duties, whereupon this kind of short
garment was called a Coat-Armour, because
it was worn aloft upon their Armour. And it
was called <hi>Paludamentum, quia ex eo gestans

was the Coat-Armour of <hi>Alexander</hi> that he

Countrey of</hi> Persia, <hi>was a City greatly renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for riches, silver, and gold. And that
there was in it a very rich Temple, wherein
were coverings of Gold, Coat-Armours and
Harness, which</hi> Alexander, <hi>King of</hi> Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
<hi>the son of</hi> Philip <hi>that reigned first in</hi>

               <p>For proof that Emperors used to wear Coat-Armours,

               <p>Of all creatures apt to generation and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
Animals are most worthy. All Beasts
have a natural and greedy desire for the supply
of their wants, insomuch as for the attaining
thereof, they do roar, bellow, bray, and cry
out exceedingly.</p>
               <p>All beasts of savage and harmful kind, are
naturally armed with some thing wherewith
they may hurt a man, for which they are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
dangerous, and to be shunned: As the
Boar with tusks, the Lion with tallons, the
Stagg with horns, the Serpent with poison,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding that the bearing of things
properly (whether vegetable or sensitive) is

commendation be extended to derogate
from the dignity of other bearings, as if they
were of no esteem, in regard they be not born
properly; for there are as good and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
intendments in these as in them, <hi>data pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate
gestantium,</hi> if they be as ancient as the
former, and their bearers of equal estate and
dignity; which is not the least respect that
must be holden in the esteem of Coat-Armour,
<hi>Quia arma nobilitatem sumunt à persona ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantis,</hi>
Arms are honoured by the bearers.
And sometimes the variation from the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may be of purpose to prevent some other
quality, which may be no lesser honourable
than the proper. Besides, it is one thing to
bear a living creature in colour or in action di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
from nature; and another, to bear him
repugnant or contrary to nature; for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
may be born commendably, but this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sort of bearing is holden disgraceful, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is condemned for false Arms, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not worthy of bearing. In the blazoning
of things born in their natural colour, whether
the same be Celestial, except the Sun, Moon,
and Stars; or Sublunar, it sufficeth to say, He
beareth this Comet, Meteor, Beast, Bird, Fish,
Fowl, Plant, Tree, Herb, Flower, &amp;c. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
without naming of any colour; for by
Proper is evermore understood his natural co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours;
and for the Sun and Stars, when they be
of the colour of the metal Or, which is their
natural colour, it sufficeth to say, a Sun, or
Star, without adding the word Proper, or Or.
And so it is of the Moon, when she is Argent,
which in Heraldry is holden her proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
               <p>As touching the dignity of things born in
Coat-Armour, I have already shewed how the
same is to be reckoned in the order of Nature;
but if it be considered according to vulgar esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
then we must hold this for an obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
that seldom faileth, That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ith every
particular Empire, Kingdom, and Nation have
their distinct Ensigns of their Sovereign Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
look what Beast, Bird, Fish, Fowl,
Serpent, &amp;c. he that swayeth the Sovereignty
doth bear for his Royal Ensign in each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Nation, the same is accounted there to
be of greatest dignity. So is the bearing of
the Lion chiefly esteemed with us in <hi>England,</hi>
because he is born by his Majesty, for the Royal
Ensign of his Highness's Imperial Sovereignty
over us: so is the bearing of the Eagle esteemed
among the <hi>Germans:</hi> &amp; in like sort the Flowers
de lis amongst the Frenchmen. Four-footed
Beasts, whether they be born Proper, or Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
(that is to say, varying from their natural
colour) are to be esteemed more worthy of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Coat-Armour than either Fishes or
Fowls are, in regard they do contain in them
more worthy and commendable significations
of Nobility. Amongst things Sensitive, the
Males are of more worthy bearing than the
Females. Some men perhaps will tax me of
inconsideration, in not treading the usual steps
of Armorists in the handling of these sensible
Creatures, for that I do not prefer the Lion
(in respect of his Regal Sovereignty) before
all other Terrestrials. For clearing of my self
in this point, I must plead, that the project of
my prescript method hath tied me to another
form, and doth enforce me to prefer other
Beasts in place, before those which otherwise
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55096:66"/>
are preferred in dignity. And albeit I cannot
say there was any priority of time in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Beasts, because <hi>God spake the word and
it was done, he commanded and they were
created;</hi> nevertheless in regard of discipline,
there is a priority to be observed, wherein
those things that do promise us a more easie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to the distinct knowledge and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the succeeding documents, ought to
have the precedence.</p>
               <p>The Order that I prefix to my self in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of these Beasts, shall concur with the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of this present Section; as first, to set down
Animals of all sorts living upon the Earth: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
such as live above the Earth, as Fowls:
Thirdly, Watry Creatures: and lastly, Man.
And because of the first sort some are gressible,
having feet, and some creeping or gliding, as
Serpents, we will begin with the gressible;
and first with such Beasts as have their feet so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
or undivided, or (as I may term them) In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>articulate,
that is to say, without toes; then
will I proceed to such as have their feet cleft in
two; and lastly to Beasts that have their feet divided into many.</p>

borrowed (saith Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne</hi>) from the
<hi>Huns, Hungarians, Scythians,</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi>
cruel and most fierce Nations, who therefore
delighted in the bearing of Beasts of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

Hyenes, and such like; which fashion likewise
came into these our Countries when those bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous

also their heads born trunked; which of some
Armorists are blazoned Cabosed, of the word
<hi>Caho,</hi> which in the Spanish Language doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
a head; which form of blazon giveth us to
understand, that it is the head of some such
beast, born sole, and of it self, having no part of
the neck thereto adherent; an accident that sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

beasts of other kinds, which most

some ancient Writers do report, That in times
past Foresters were wont to call him a Stag at
the fourth year, and not a Staggard, as we do
now; and at the fifth year they called him a
Great Stag: And so they were wont to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish

               <p>The knowledge of the Ordure or Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of every Beast of Venery and Chase is
necessary to be observed; because their Ordures
are a principal note, whereby good Foresters
and Woodmen do know and observe the place
of their haunt and feeding, and also their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state:
And therefore it is a thing highly to be
observed, for that a Forester or Woodman, in
making his reports, shall be constrained to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse
the same.

               <p>These Beasts of Chase do make their abode
all the day time in the Fields, and upon the
Hills and high Mountains, where they may see
round about them afar off, for preventing their
danger: For these are more timerous of their
own safety, than dangerous and harmful to
men. And in the night time, when men be at
rest, and all things quiet, then do they make
their repair to the Corn-fields and Medows for
food and relief; for which respect they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Campesties,</hi> because they do haunt the Field

bisulca,</hi> which have their feet part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only into two Claws: The next part
of our Distribution containeth those which are
called <hi>Multifida,</hi> which have many Claws;
of which sort are not only Lions, Bears, Wolves,
and others of fierce and ravenous kind, that
live by prey and spoil; but such also as are of
timorous nature, whose chiefest safety consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
rather in swiftness of foot, than in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
means, as Foxes, Hares, Conies, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of less harmful kind, whereof I will
give particular Examples: But first I will offer
unto your heedful Observation certain Notes,
as well of general as of particular use, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beasts of this kind; not forgetting (by the
way) such Rules and Observations as have
been already commended to your regard, that
especially touching mixt bearing of Ordinaries
and common Charges, which must serve for a
Regular Direction throughout our whole
Work. And in delivery of these Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Examples, I hold it fit to begin with
beasts of fierce nature, and first with the Lion,
reckoned the King of beasts; <hi>Dignioribus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim
digniora loca sunt danda,</hi> Highest person
highest place.</p>
               <p>Some French Armorists are of opinion, That
the Lion should never be made Guardant, or full-faced,
affirming that to be proper to the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard,
wherein they offer great indignity to that
royal beast, in that they will not admit him
(saith <hi>Vpton</hi>) to shew his full face, the sight
whereof doth terrifie and astonish all the beasts
of the field, and wherein consisteth his chiefest
Majesty, and therefore may not be denied that
Prerogative, <hi>Quia omnia Animalia debent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pingi
&amp; designari in suo ferociori actu, ex illis

               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:55096:73"/>All beasts should be set forth in their most ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
action, for therein they shew their
chiefest vigour. As concerning the true Note
whereby the Leopard is distinguished from the
Lion, <hi>Vpton lib. de Armis</hi> writeth thus, <hi>Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noscitur
Leopardus à Leone, quia Leopardus
ubique depingitur habens naturaliter maculas
nigras, cum grosso capite, &amp; est Animal pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
non hispidum: Leo verò habet unum colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem
continuum, cum pectore hispido, cum certis
jubis in canda.</hi> The Leopard is portrayed
with black spots, and a great head, and no
where shaggy; whereas the Lion is one colour,
shaggy brea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed, with a certain tuft of hair in
his train. So that it is evident that the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard
is notably distinguish'd both in shape and
colour, and not by his full-faced Countenance,
as they dream. Moreover <hi>Vpton</hi> saith, That
he hath often observed Leopards born by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Noblemen, as well half-faced as guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant.</p>
               <p>It is observed that the generous nature of the
Lion is discerned by his plentiful shaggy locks
that do cover his neck and shoulders, which are
infallible tokens of his noble Courage, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if those his locks be crisped and curled, and
short withal. Such Lions were those whereof
Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> maketh mention, <hi>In vita Pauli
Eeremitae,</hi> saying, <hi>Talia in anima volvente, ecce
duo Leones ex interioris Eremi parte curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
volantibus per colla jubis ferebantur:</hi>
Two Lions came running with their shaggy
locks wavering about their shoulders. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
the thickness of the Lion's mane is a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of his generous birth, and by the same
he is distinguished from the degenerate and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard
race of Leopards begotten between the
adulterous Lioness and the Parde, which are
naturally deprived of this noble mark; and not
only so, but they are also bereft of that bold
and invincible Courage that the generous sort
of Lions have. For these respects the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
brood of Lions are called in Latin, <hi>Imbelles
Leones,</hi> that is, Heartless and Cowardly Lions;
whereas the true Lion is termed in Latin, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosus
Leo, quia generosum est quod à natura
sua non degeneravit;</hi> That is generous which
degenerateth not from his kind: by which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
a man of Noble Descent, and Ignoble Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
is not truly generous, because he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generateth
from the Vertues of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.</p>
               <p>Lions, Bears, Wolves, and other beasts of
ravening kind, when they are born in Arms
feeding, you must tearm them in blazon Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and tell whereon. To all beasts of prey
Nature hath assigned teeth and talons of crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
shape, and therewithal of great sharpness,
to the end they may strongly seize upon and
detain their prey, and speedily rend and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the same. And therefore in blazoning of
beasts of this kind, you must not omit to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
their teeth and tallons, which are their
only Armour; for by them they are distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from those tame and harmless beasts, that
have their teeth knocked out, and their nails
pared so near to the quick, as that they can
neither bite nor scratch with much harm.
Those teeth and tallons are for the most part in
Coat-Armours made of a different colour from
the bodies of the beasts; and therefore in bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoning
of beasts of this kind, when you speak
of their teeth or tallons, you shall say they are
thus or thus Armed. So likewise if you please
to speak of their tongues, you shall say they are
thus or thus Langued.</p>
               <p>To bear a Lion or whatsoever Animal in a
diverse colour from his kindly or natural co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
as to bear a blue, green, red, purple Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Bear, &amp;c. or whatsoever other colour dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from that which is natural unto him, is
not a bearing reproachful, though disagreeing
to his Nature, if we consider of the occasion
of their primary constitution; for that the
custome of such bearing seemeth to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from eminent persons, who habiting
themselves either for their sports of Hunting,
or for Military Services (as best fitted their
phantasies) would withal sute their Armours
and Habiliments with colours answerable to
their habits, with the shapes and portraitures
of forged and counterfeit Animals.</p>
               <p>Or else perhaps by occasion of some civil
tumults, as that between the <hi>Guelphi</hi> and the
<hi>Gibelini</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> they perhaps of each faction
bearing Lions, Bears, and Wolves, or other
Animals, to avoid confusion, and to the end
the one of them should not be entrapped by
the other of the contrary faction, when they
were intermixed one with another, and that
their valorous actions might be more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
discerned from the other, they distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves by different and unlike coloured
Garments, that so each Governour and Leader
might know those that were of his own facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>The like may we observe to have been of
late years used among ourselves, when private
factions have sprung amongst us; one sort was
known from others of the contrary faction by
a Carnation Ribond worn about, or in his Hat;
or by a Crimson Feather, or other thing: the
contrary faction wearing like thing, but in a
different colour or fashion.</p>
               <p>The Lion (<hi>saith</hi> Vpton) passing thorow stony
places, doth contract his Tallons within his
flesh, and so walketh on his feet as if he had
no Tallons at all, keeping them exceeding
choicely, lest he should dull and blunt their
sharpness, and so become less able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach
and rend his prey. <hi>And this property
seemeth not to be peculiar to a Lion, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all beasts of rapine; as</hi> Pliny <hi>ascribeth
the same property to Leopards, Panthers, and
such other, as well as to the Lion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not only Lions, but also all other beasts of
ravenous kind (according to <hi>Bekenhawb</hi>) do
bring forth their young in some part defective;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55096:74"/>
as Lions do produce their Whelps dead, Dogs
bring them forth blind, Bears deformed and
shapeless, &amp;c. For Nature would not that they
should attain perfection in the womb, in regard
of the safety of their Dam, lest in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
they should spoil and rent her womb by
their teeth and tallons.</p>
               <p>Other more particular Rules there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the divers kinds and peculiar actions of
beasts of Rapine, which shall follow in their
more convenient places. In the mean time,
let us proceed to Examples that may give life
and approbation to those premised Rules; <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepta

King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and his eldest Son; but after

in the said County, Esquire. As touching the
bearing of the Lion after this manner, I hold
that then he may be truly said to be rampant,
when he standeth so directly upright, as that
the crown of his head doth answer to the plant
of his foot, whereupon he standeth in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
line, and not by placing of the left
foot in the dexter corner of the Escocheon, as
<hi>Leigh</hi> would have it. As the former Example
sheweth the gesture of the Lion pursuing his
prey; so this sheweth his gesture in seizing on
it when he hath attained it.</p>

<hi>Leigh</hi> saith, That
these were two Lions of sundry Regions, which
of manhood must combate only for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
For the Lion is as desirous of mastery
as a couragious Prince is ambitious of Honour;
which if it be in a just Title and Claim, is a
vertue in a King, and no way to be disliked?
For it was a Royal Apothegm worthy that
great King, <hi>Nemo me major, nisi qui justior;</hi>
I acknowledge no King greater than my self,
but he that is juster.</p>
               <figure/>

               <figure/>
               <p>The Lion beareth his tail after a diverse man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
insomuch as we may thereby (if not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
know, yet give a near ghess) what a
mood he is in for the present; <hi>viz.</hi> whether
he be furiously bent, or peaceable, or majesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
affected. And these qualities are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
discerned by the Inversion, Eversion, or
Extension, &amp;c. of his tail.</p>
               <p>Here may rise a Question, Whether the
bearing of the tail of the Lion in any of these
several manners be a sufficient difference to
prevent all causes of challenge?</p>
               <p>For my own part (albeit I have not read or
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55096:80"/>
seen in <hi>Gerard Leigh, Boswell, Ferne,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Armorial Writers, the state of this
Question handled) I hold that they be differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
sufficient to debarr all challenge: My
Reasons are these; first, <hi>Sufficit quod inter
arma mea &amp; tua talis sit differentia, qua detur
diversitas.</hi> And again, <hi>Nova forma dat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum
esse rei:</hi> I hold them not only to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
<hi>secundum quid,</hi> but <hi>simpliciter;</hi> that
is to say, absolute and essential differences.
Furthermore, <hi>Data una dissimilitudine etiam
paria judicabuntur diversa.</hi> Moreover, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
sheweth us, That the least addition or
subtraction in Armorial signs maketh them
cease to be the same that they were; <hi>Omnia
Arma Arithmeticis figuris sunt simillima, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
si quid addas vel subtrahas, non remanet
eadem species,</hi> as I have formerly shewed.
Finally, for approbation of these my Opinions,
I will add this infallible Assertion, <hi>Ea differunt
quorum definitiones differunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are my Reasons that induce me to be
of this Opinion, that the diverse manner of
bearing of the tail of the Lion, as aforesaid, are
or may be (without exception) essential diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences:
which nevertheless I referr to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
censure of the Learned in this Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
who perhaps may convince me with more
forceable grounds.</p>
               <p>But because Demonstration is the best of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to convince the incredulous, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
that <hi>Buxton</hi>'s Coat before mentioned,
differs not from that of <hi>Smeres,</hi> but only in
the manner of the bearing of the tail, both of
them being Argent, a Lion rampant, Sable;
only in <hi>Buxton</hi>'s Coat the tail is elevated and
turned over the head of the Lion, as it more
plainly appears before in this present Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Now as touching particularizing of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned
assertion, I say that the Eversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the tail of the Lion is an express token of
his placability or tractableness: as contrariwise
the Inversion of his tail is a note of wrath and
fury, especially if he do beat the back there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
and doth roar withal. Of this proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Lion <hi>Catullus</hi> maketh mention in these
words,
<q>
                     <l>Age, caede terga cauda tua, verbera pateant</l>
                     <l>Face, cuncta mugienti fremitu loca retonent.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The gate of a Lion, when he is passant, is an
apparent note of his jurisdiction and regal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and sovereignty wherewith the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his tail doth fitly quadrate and agree:
inasmuch as when he hunteth after his prey,
he roareth vehemently, whereat the Beasts
being astonished, do make a stand, whilst he
with his tail maketh a circle about them in the
sand, which circle they dare not transgress;
which done, out of them he makeh choice of
his prey at his pleasure.</p>

               <p>Thus ending with the Wolf, I will perclose
this Tract of Beasts of fierce Nature, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
all others of this kind, as <hi>Ounces,
Lynxes, Hyenaes, Panthers, &amp;c.</hi> under these
before handled. Forasmuch as the greatest
part of the general Rules, as also of the sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
forms of bearing attributed unto Lions and
Wolves, may be aptly applied to all, or the
greatest part of other Beasts of like Nature.</p>

               <p>HAVING given Examples of raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and fierce kind, that by main force
do prosecute and obtain their prey; I
will now proceed to the handling of Beasts less
fell and harmful: of which number some are
wild and savage; other are domestical and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable,
as Dogs of all sorts, of which I will
first intreat; because the Dog, whether it be
for pleasure and game in field, or for thrift and
guard at home, deserveth a very high estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and of all Dogs, those of chase are most
in use in Armory; whereof some prosecute
their prey speedily, others more leisurably.

Sable, three Greyhounds current in pale,
Argent, collared, Or, is the Coat-Armour of
the ancient Family of the <hi>Machels</hi> of <hi>Craken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi>
in <hi>Westmoreland;</hi> and is now born by
<hi>Lancelot Machel,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> Lieutenant of Horse to
the Counties of <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmoreland,</hi>
a great Loyalist, and an expert Souldier. This
Name was writ <hi>Mauchael,</hi> or <hi>Mauchel,</hi> from
the Conquest to the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth, at which time those two valiant War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers,
<hi>Guy Mauchel</hi> of <hi>Crakenthorp,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> and
<hi>Hugh</hi> his Brother, engaged themselves in that
Expedition against the French, in which the
English were victorious, and took the almost
impregnable City of <hi>Turnay,</hi> from whence they
both returned, and were successively Lords of
<hi>Crakenthorp</hi> aforesaid. This <hi>Guy,</hi> though in
many dangers, yet died in his Bed about the
<hi>27th</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, but shewed an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
and Marshal Spirit in bequeathing his
Arms and Armour to his Sons in the very first
place, as that which was most dear unto him.
And <hi>Hugh Machel,</hi> for his Valour, was by King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth deputed with Sir <hi>Thomas
Wharton,</hi> Warden of the west Marshes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
by a Warrant under the said King's Sign
Manual, Dated the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>Iune</hi> in the <hi>29th</hi>

Beasts, among them of savage kind before

fearful Nature: Such are these that follow, and
their like.</p>

               <p>And hitherto we have handled such Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial
Animals only, as are called <hi>Vivipara,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they do bring forth living Creatures;
whereas the other Terrestrials do bring forth
eggs, and are therefore named <hi>Ovipara,</hi> of
which sort we will speak in the next place.</p>

               <p>THIS other sort of four-footed Egg-bearing
Animals (as I may so term
them) notwithstanding that in many
things they have no small resemblance with
man, as well touching the faculties of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable
soul, as also the parts of the body; yet
are they far more unlike us, than those that
bring forth a living Creature. And albeit that
these Egg-breeding four-footed Animals do
consist of the same bodily parts that the <hi>Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>para,</hi>
or Animal-producing do, and of the four
humours that are answerable in quality to the
four Elements, and have all parts, as well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
as external senses, and many other things
wherein they do communicate with the <hi>Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>para;</hi>
yet are there many other things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they differ not only from these, but also even
amongst themselves one from another of them.
For neither do we find in these that quickness
of wit that we observe in others, neither like
parts of strength of body that the other
have.</p>
               <p>Like as man (especially in his soul) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth
near unto God in likeness: so in like
manner do other Animals resemble man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they do participate with man in likeness af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some sort, but in divers degrees; forasmuch
as some of them have more, and some less like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with us than others have.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is not (<hi>saith</hi> Beda) amongst the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Works of Nature, any one thing so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
or of so base esteem, wherein a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find some Divine thing worthy of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
No less (<hi>saith</hi> Farnesius) may we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the force of a silly Flea, than the hugeness
and strength of an Elephant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not without reason doth the Husbandman
prognosticate the approach of some great
shower of Rain by the croaking of Frogs more
frequent than usually; whereupon he saith,
<hi>that they do cry for rain.</hi> For this Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is grounded upon a Physical Reason, <hi>Omne
enim simile gaudet suo simili, &amp; suae naturae
utili ac convenienti;</hi> every like is delighted
with his like, and with that which is commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
and agreeable to his Nature. Since then
that Frogs are exceedingly delighted with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as with that which best agreeth with their
Nature; therefore when they do apprehend a
foresense of Rain they do rejoice, and do testifie
their joy by singing after their manner.</p>
               <p>Animals of base esteem, and of no industry,
have (for the most part) not only four, but
manifold feet: whereby we are admonished,
that perverse and evil disposed persons have
multiplicities of affections, in respect that by
the motion of the feet our bodies are perduced
from place to place; so do our affections trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
us from one delight to another, according
to that saying, <hi>Pes meus, affectus meus; eo fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
quocunque feror.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though some perhaps may esteem these
Egg-bearing Animals unworthy the dignity of
Coat-Armour; yet for my own part, I hold
their bearing to be no less honourable, than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of those that in common estimation are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
far more worthy; insomuch that they
may well beseem the bearing of the greatest
Potentate. For if it pleased the Sovereign
King of Kings to use them as his special Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to chastise the stubborness of such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled
against his Ordinance, and to arm those
his minute and weak Creatures, with such an
incredible boldness, as that they feared not the
face or forces of men, but that the very Frogs
entred the houses and chambers of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
upon the people, into their ovens, and
into their kneading-throughs; yea, even into
King <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Chamber, and upon his Bed.
Moreover, if God hath vouchsafed to give to
the Grashopper, the Canker-worm, the Catter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piller,
and the Palmer-worm, the honourable
Title of his huge great Army: Why should we
prize them at so low a rate, as that we should
disdain to bear them in Coat-Armour? Since
God saith by the Prophet <hi>Ioel, I will render
you the years which the Grashopper hath eaten,
the Canker-worm, and the Catterpiller, and
the Palmer-worm, my great Host which I sent
among you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is therefore to be observed, that they also
have their actions not to be omitted in Blazon,
albeit not in that variable manner, nor yet so
copious as some others. And because they are
far different from those formerly handled, not
only in shape, but also in the manner of their
living, in their gate and actions; therefore must
they receive a divers manner of Blazon. They
are called in Latin <hi>Reptilia,</hi> or creeping things;
<hi>Quia reptant super terram.</hi> And here we must
distinguish between those things <hi>quae reptant,</hi>
which creep, as Frogs, Ants, &amp;c. and those
<hi>quae serpunt,</hi> which glide, as Snakes; which
latter kind we shall speak of afterward.</p>
               <p>But here we mention those <hi>Reptiles</hi> which
are gressible, such as by means of their feet are
able to go step by step from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
so termed <hi>à gradiendo,</hi> which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
by degrees: And hitherto also are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
such as by skipping, mounting, or leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
raise their bodies above ground, and so
alter their station, place, or seat. Of which
kinds some have four feet, some have more.
Such as have four feet only, are these that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
with their like.</p>
               <p>I have omitted in this Edition that Escoche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Sol, charged with three Toads erected, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
which according to some Authors, was
the Coat-Armour of the ancient Kings of
<hi>France;</hi> because since my last Edition I find
great variety of opinions concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
of which I have given a touch in the first
Chapter of the first Section. And in lieu thereof
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55096:84"/>
I do present you with the ancient Coat-Armour
of the same Charge, born by a Family in this
Kingdom.</p>

                  <hi>Bara</hi> in his Book intituled, <hi>Les Blazones
dez Armories,</hi> giveth an Example of two Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,
erected one against another (as if they
were combatant) and termeth them rampant,
a term very unfitly applied to <hi>Reptiles,</hi> to
whom the terms of mounting, leaping, or skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
are much more proper. To this head must
be reduced Crocodiles, Salamanders, Chameli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Ewets, Lizards, and whatsoever other
Egg-bearing Reptile, having only four feet, as
to their natural and proper place. There rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
yet one other sort of this kind of <hi>Reptiles,</hi>
which are diversly shaped from all the former,
and are called in Latin <hi>Insecta animalia;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that being divided in their body between
their head and belly, their parts do seem so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
as if they hang'd only together by small
strings; having no flesh, blood, sinues, &amp;c. And
there are also <hi>Insecta</hi> which slie; but here we
speak only of Terrestrials, leaving the other
to their due place. And because such bearing
is rare, I am inforced (rather than to pass them
over with silence) to use Coats of Device, for
expressing their sundry forms, as in Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

                  <hi>A very remarkable Note doth</hi> Farnesius <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
unto us, taken from this poor despised
Creature the Spider, touching the Procreation
of Children: It is a matter of great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of what Parents a man is descended.</hi>
If we desire (<hi>saith he</hi>) to have a good race
of Horses, a litter of special good Hounds for
game, choice Plants and Stocks to plant our
Orchards and Gardens with delectable fruits,
do we not use our uttermost endeavour to effect
them? How much greater should our care and
providence be in the procreation of our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?
The first instruction that the Children
receive, is in the veins and bowels of their
Parents, whereof we may take an Example
from Spiders, which are no sooner hatched
and excluded out of their Eggs, but forthwith
they practise to make webs, as if they had
brought with them (even out of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
womb) together with their life, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
skill of webbing. Holy and reverent
is that piety that we owe to our Parents; <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens
enim est genitor, parens patria, parens
denique est ipse Deus.</hi> For he that begot us is
our parent, our Countrey is our parent, and
lastly God himself is our parent.</p>
               <p>It hath been often questioned, <hi>Why the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
loveth the Son more dearly, tenderly, and
affectionately, than the Son doth the Father.</hi>
The Reason is this, <hi>Quia patris amor in filium
à natura est, filij in parentem ab officio.</hi> The
affectionate love of the Father proceedeth of
Nature, that of the Son of duty. Therefore
the sacred Law hath decreed, <hi>Amabis patrem
&amp; matrem tuam, Thou shalt love thy Father and
Mother,</hi> but not contrariwise: For where the
Law of Nature speaketh, there is no need it
should be assisted by Commandment. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
(even naturally) the love of the
Son to the Father is great.</p>
               <p>We may learn (<hi>saith</hi> Zanchius) by these
minute Animals, how many and how great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
we may receive from the universal
number of Creatures, that God hath given us
for Instructors and teachers of Moral Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
so that we will open our eyes to behold
them, and listen to God's disciplining us in
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Admirable doubtless is the Omnipotency of
God in these Creatures; for as St.</hi> Hierome
<hi>saith,</hi> Epist. ad Heliod. Creatorem non in Caelo
tantum miramur, &amp;c. We do not admire God's
power in heaven only, and in the earth the
Sun, Elephants, Camels, Oxen, Boars, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
&amp;c. but also in his smallest Creatures, the
Ant, Flea, Fly, and small Worm, and others
of like kind, whose bodies or shapes are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
known unto us than their names.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much were the</hi> Israelites <hi>assotted in Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
as that they esteemed beasts for gods, as
appeareth</hi> Wisd. 12. 24. For they went astray
far in the ways of errour, and esteemed the
beasts, which their enemies despised, for gods;
being abused after the manner of children that
have no understanding.</p>
               <p>So long is any Animal or living Creature
said to have life, as he hath breath and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
thereof. And this Rule holdeth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in fourfooted Animals, but also in those that
we call <hi>Insecta,</hi> and in gliding Animals also,
as both <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> do teach; though <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi>
denieth these latter to have breath, but
therein he speaketh comparatively, <hi>viz.</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of other Animals, that do attract and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
their breath more strongly and more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly,
they seem to have no breath at all.</p>
               <p>One Example more I will propose, which
shall be of the Emmet, as in this next Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheon.</p>

that kind which hath more than four feet, I
have alledged only the two last Examples of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secta,</hi>
yet there are some other of many feet,
which are not <hi>Insecta;</hi> as the Palmer-worm,
Cheeslip, Kitchinbobs, which being touched,
gather themselves round like a Ball, and such
like, which must be referred to the same head.
And besides all these, there are yet othersome
which be both gressible and volant; such are
those, that having their livelyhood only upon
the earth, by the help of a kind of wings they
oftentimes change their place for the acquiring
of their sustenance, as in Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>There are other of this kind, whose wings
are less manifest than the Grashoppers, because
they are closed in a kind of case that can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be discerned, but when they are preparing
to fly; for which respect they are called <hi>Vagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pennae</hi>
(saith <hi>Calepine) Quia alas vaginis

wings sheathed; as the Hart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ly, Beetle, Lady-cow,
&amp;c. which, together with Locusts, and
such other as are both gressible and volant, and
many-legged, are to be reduced to this head,
as to their proper and natural place. I will
close up all these with one Example of the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
which <hi>Aelianus</hi> and others report to be
winged in <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> though he doubts
whether they are not rather bred by the heat
of the Sun, than by copulation; and if by this
latter, whether they come of Eggs, or come
forth living.</p>

               <p>NOW touching such Creatures as we
termed Gliding: Those may proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be said to be such, which having
no feet at all, do yet move, and as it were
slide from place to place; some more slowly,
but othersome with a certain volubility and
flexible agitation of the body do make their

               <figure/>
               <p>To the four-footed Egg-bearing Animals do
the Serpents come very nigh, as also other
<hi>Reptiles,</hi> For all Serpents have blood, flesh,
sinews, and other like parts as four-footed Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
have, although not in that perfection that
they have them. They are indowed also with
head, nostrils, eyes, tongue, teeth, and with
lights and spleen, and other inward parts and
bowels of the body, but much discrepant from
the members and bowels of all others</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding that Serpents are far une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to four-footed Animals, both in shape and
strength; yet will they not give place to many
of them for sharpness of wit. It is a Creature
full of subtilty, as <hi>Moses</hi> testifieth, <hi>Gen. 3. And
the Serpent was more subtile than any Beast of
the field:</hi> For besides his exterior senses, he is
crafty and subtile in preserving his life, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
choice of his lurking dens, in acquiring
his food, in hatching up his brood, in expelling
from him, and putting off his old slough. So
that for good cause did our Saviour exhort us
(in goodness) to imitate the wisdome of the
Serpent.</p>
               <p>These few Examples may serve instead of
many, which might be brought of Serpents of
sundry other names and natures, which all are
hither to be referred. Now let us see one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of such gliding or sliding Animals as are
more slow-paced, and have both skin and shell
to cover them; of which number is the Snail,
reckoned of all other that are born in Coat-Armour,
the slowest. And no marvel, since
it carrieth on her back no less a burden than her
whole house; for which cause she is called <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digrada

               <p>A Second general Member of our Division
of living Creatures, concerning such as
live above the Earth in the Air, as are
the Fowls and Birds of all sorts: and as we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
the former by their feet, so the same
Method we will follow in these. Their feet
therefore are in some whole or conjoyned; in
others divided. The whole-footed do in a sort
resemble the palm of a mans hand, and are
therefore in Latin called <hi>Palmipedes;</hi> such as
the Swan, Goose, Duck, and for the most part
all River Fowls, as partly shall appear hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by Examples. But here I hold it necessary,
entring into this Discourse, to set down some
general Rules or Notes concerning the bearing
of Birds or Fowls, that the Reader may know
whither to resort for a resolution of such doubts
as may arise touching their bearing. Fowls or
Birds are of more worthy bearing in Coat-Armour
than Fishes, because they do more
participate of air and fire (the two noblest and
highest Elements) than of water or earth.
All fowls, of whatsoever kind, must be born
in Coat-Armour, as is best fitting the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their natural actions, of going, sitting,
standing, flying, &amp;c. Otherwise such Armory
shall be said to be false, because <hi>Ars imitatur
naturam in quantum potest;</hi> Art as much as
possible it can, doth imitate Nature. All Birds
are mustered under the name of Fowls, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their <hi>Genus</hi> or General, and so may seem
(after a sort) to be one. Nevertheless, in their
<hi>Species,</hi> or several kinds, they differ much
touching their particular qualities; for some of
them are simple, some others subtile, some
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55096:86"/>
solitary, some sociable, some melodious, some
articulate, some docible, some doltish and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docible,
some of long continuance, and some
only of a few months lasting. <hi>Leigh</hi> saith,
<hi>That Birds in an Escocheon shall be numbred
unto Ten, and if they exceed that number, then
they shall be said to be</hi> sans number, <hi>and shall be
so blazoned.</hi> But <hi>Chassaneus</hi> saith, <hi>that they shall
be numbred unto sixteen;</hi> and of such bearing
and blazoning he giveth instances of Monsieur
<hi>Montmorancie,</hi> and of the Lord <hi>Lovale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the beaks or bills and feet of
Birds, most Armorists finding them to be of a
different colour from the rest of the body, do
term them all generally <hi>membred.</hi> But under
reformation of the skill, I hold, that as there
is a difference in the Nobility of Birds, so ought
they to have distinct terms of blazon: So that all
those that either are whole-footed, or have
their feet divided, and yet have no Tallons,
should be termed <hi>membred.</hi> But the Cock, and
also all Birds of prey, should be termed in bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon
<hi>armed;</hi> forasmuch as Nature hath assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Cock (being a Bird much addicted to
battel) spurs; and to the Birds of prey, sharp
and hooked beaks and tallons, not only for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
and defence, but also to seize upon,
gripe, and rend their prey, and are to them as
teeth and claws unto Lions, Tigres, and other
fierce Beasts. <hi>Similium enim similis est ratio;</hi>
where the things are like, the reason is like.
It is generally observed, that amongst Fowls
of prey, the Female is the noblest and most
hardy: which Nature did so provide, because
(besides her own sustenance) the care of feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her young doth especially lie on the Female;
and therefore if she should be timorous or cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly,
she would not be able to provide food
for herself and them. <hi>Such Fowls</hi> (saith <hi>Vpton)
as either in respect of their uniformity do never
change colour naturally, or by nature are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly
coloured, shall be only named in blazon,
and no mention at all made of their colours, but
shall be termed proper; unless they either in part,
or in whole, be born of some other colour than
is natural to them.</hi> In the blazoning of Fowls
much exercised in flight, if their wings be not
displaied, they shall be said to be <hi>born close;</hi>
as he beareth an Eagle, Falcon, Swallow, &amp;c.
<hi>close.</hi> As in other forementioned Creatures,
so in Fowls also, besides the whole bearing, the
parts or members are also usually born in Coat-Armour,
as the heads, wings, feathers, and
Legs: and both couping and erasing are as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
unto the parts of Fowls, as of those
Terrestrials, as by Examples following shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
wherein I will first begin with River
Fowls (which for the most part are whole-footed)
using neither curiousness in their form
of placing, or copiousness in their number; but
only that by the assistance of some few chief
Examples, that which hath been delivered by
Precepts and Rules, may be the more easily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</p>

               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>Under these sorts will I briefly comprehend
all River-Fowls whatsoever, <hi>viz.</hi> all such as
are whole-footed under the former; and all
Cranes, Herns, Cormorants, &amp;c. under this
latter; for that albeit they be of the kind of
River-Fowls, yet have they their feet divided.</p>

            <div n="20" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XX.</head>
               <p>AFTER those River-Fowls whole-footed
and divided, by order it now falleth
to hand that I should proceed to such
Fowls as do frequent, partly the Air, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Land; of which some are Fowls of
prey, othersome are Predable, or fit to be
made a Prey.</p>
               <p>Such as are Fowls of prey have their Beaks
and Tallons evermore hooked and sharp: hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for sure seizing and detaining; and sharp for
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55096:87"/>
speedy rending and dividing thereof. Such are
Eagles of all sorts, Vultures, Falcons, Gerfal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
Sakers, Lanerts, Tercels, Sparhawks,
Marlins, &amp;c, as also Kites, Buzzards, Owls, &amp;c.
<hi>Of Fowls</hi> (saith <hi>Pliny) those that have hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
claws and tallons, are not fruitful breeders,
for the most part; wherein Nature hath well
provided for all kinds of Fowls, that the
mightier should not be so copious as the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and such as do fly from the tyrauny of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
Some of these Fowls of prey are (in
their kind) ennoblished by nature in as high
a degree of Nobility, as the chiefest of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
Animals before handled. Such are those
that do much frequent the Air, as Eagles and
Hawks of all sorts, which are much exercised
in flying; and albeit they do build their nests,
and have their feeding upon the earth, yet is
their agitation above in the air. Therefore in
regard of the worthiness of the Element where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are chiefly occupied, I will begin with
Birds of prey, and after our former order, first
with their whole bearing, and so descend to
the parts (promiscuously) of sundry Birds,
according to the dignity of their place, or more
noble use, as in Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cajus Iulius Caesar,</hi> Son of <hi>Lucius Caesar</hi> a
Roman, in the year before Christ 52, having
conquered <hi>France,</hi> overcame also <hi>Cassibulan</hi>
King of <hi>Britain,</hi> and made the Island become
Tributary to him and his Successors 483 years,
at which time <hi>Constantine</hi> of <hi>Amorica</hi> obtained
the Kingdom; he bore Sol, an Eagle display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Saturn, armed, Mars.</p>
               <p>Topaz, an Eagle displayed, Diamond; was
the Coat of <hi>Edwyn</hi> a Saxon, who at the time
of the Conquest was Earl of <hi>Coventry;</hi> and
he with Earl <hi>Swardus,</hi> and <hi>Marker</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
kept the <hi>Isle of Ely</hi> against the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
for which cause he was banished the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and afterwards was slain in <hi>Scotland</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Issue.</p>
               <p>Argent, an Eagle displayed, Sable, is the
Coat-Armour of Sir <hi>Theophilus Bidulph</hi> of
<hi>East-Greenwich</hi> in <hi>Kent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gules, an Eagle displayed, Or, is the Coat-Armour
of the <hi>Goddards</hi> of <hi>Norfolk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Eagle having her wings thus displayed,
doth manifest her industrious exercise, in that
she is not idle, but continually practiseth that
course of life whereunto nature hath ordained
her: and doth signifie a man of action, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
occupied in high and weighty affairs, and
one of a lofty spirit, ingenious, speedy in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
and judicious in matters of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity.
For amongst other noble qualities in
the Eagle, her sharpness and strength of sight
is much commended; and it is a greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to one of noble Off-spring to be wise and
of sharp and deep understanding, than to be
rich or powerful, or great by birth. The Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
is the most honourable bearing of Birds;
and for its swiftness of slight, was called the
Messenger of the Gods.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The Eagle is said to be <hi>Altivolans avis,</hi> an
high-soaring Bird, that sometime flieth so high
a pitch, as that she transcendeth the view of
man. She hath a tender care of her young: when
they be fligg or flush (as we say) and ready
for flight, then she stirreth up her nest and
fluttereth over them; yea, she taketh them on
her wings, and so soareth with them through
the Air, and carrieth them aloft, and so freeth
them from all danger. In that she carrieth her
young ones rather upon her wings than in her
tallons, she sheweth her tender care and love
that she beareth unto them. She is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
full of feathers, by means whereof she gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
through the Air very lightly, and maketh
way through the same with great expedition
and swiftness. <hi>Our persecutors</hi> (saith <hi>Ieremiah)
are swifter than the Eagles of heaven.</hi> And
again, 2 <hi>Sam. 1. 23. Saul and Ionathan were
swifter than Eagles.</hi> The Crown of her head
is enlarged with baldness as her years are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased.
As we may see <hi>Michah 1. 16. Make
thee bald and shave thee for thy delicate chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
Enlarge thy baldness as the Eagle, for
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:55096:88"/>
they are gone into captivity from thee.</hi> Wherein
the Prophet alludeth to the customes of the
Gentiles, who in the time of their mourning
used to shave their heads, and cut their flesh,
and to scorch the same with stigmatical marks,
which customs God did expresly forbid the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
to use, as appeareth <hi>Deuteronomy</hi>
14. 1.</p>

               <p>As the Terrestrial Animals have their peculiar
actions and gestures, so doubtless have Birds
and Fowls their gesture according to their kind:
for sometime we find them born pearching,
which action is more usual with Birds or Fowls
of prey that are throughly mained &amp; brought
to the fist, as in this Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Now since we are
come to treat of Fowls of prey; whereof
(next to the Eagle, which is reckoned the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Queen of all Fowls, like as the Lion is
reputed the King of all Beasts) the Goshawk,
the Falcon, the Gerfalcon, and all other long-winged
Hawks; as also all Sparhawks, Marli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Hobbeys, and other like small Fowl of
prey are the chief, it shall not be altogether
impertinent (though therein I do somewhat
digress from my principal purpose) if I give
some little touch of the propriety of terms
commonly used of Falconers in managing
their Hawks, and things to them appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
according to the slenderness of my skill,
always subscribing herein to the censure and
reformation of professed Falconers. The cause
of this my digression is, the desire I have to
give some superficial taste unto Gentlemen of
the terms of Falconry, like as I have done
Chap. 14. of the terms of skilful Woodmen
or Huntsmen: That so in their mutual conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
together, they may be able to speak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
(though but superficially) and deliver
their minds in apt terms, when in their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
they happen to fall into discourse of the
noble recreations and delights, either of our
generous Armorial Profession, or of Hunting
and Hawking; that so the standers by may say
of them (when they shall observe their skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
discourses) as old Father <hi>Simon</hi> said to <hi>Sosia</hi>
his late Bondman, touching the delights of his
Son <hi>Pamphilus, Ter. And.</hi>
               </p>
               <l>Quod plerique omnes faciunt adole scentuli,</l>
               <l>Vt animum ad aliquod studium adjungant, aut
equos</l>
               <l>Alere, aut canes ad venandum, aut ad Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophos:</l>
               <l>Horum ille nihil egregie praeter caetera</l>
               <l>Studebat, &amp; tamen omnia haec mediocriter.</l>
               <p>It is a usual thing with the most part of
young men to delight themselves, either in
pampering of Horses, or to cherish Dogs for
hunting, or to addict themselves to the study
of Philosophy; he fixed not his delight in any
one of these more than another, yet was he
meetly well seen in them all.</p>
               <p>The terms of Falconry, that I purpose to
touch in this place, are briefly these that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>First, a Hawk is said to bate, when she striveth
to fly from the fist.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:55096:90"/>
She is said to rebate, when by the motion of
the bearers hand she recovereh the fist.</p>
               <p>You must say, feed your hawk, and not give
her meat.</p>
               <p>A hawk is said (after she hath fed) she smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
or sweepeth her beak, and not wipeth her beak or bill.</p>
               <p>By the beak of an hawk is understood the
upper part which is nooked.</p>
               <p>The neather part of the beak is called the
hawks clap.</p>
               <p>The holes in the hawks beak are called her
Nares.</p>
               <p>The yellow between the beak and the eyes
is called the Sere.</p>
               <p>Hawks of long small black feathers like hairs
about the Sere, are properly called Crinites.</p>
               <p>You must say your hawk jouketh, and not
sleepeth.</p>
               <p>Also your hawk pruneth, and not picketh
herself.</p>
               <p>But your hawk cannot be said properly to
prune herself, but when she beginneth at her
legs, and fetcheth moisture at her tail, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
she embalmeth her feet, and striketh the
feathers of her wings through her beak.</p>
               <p>Her fetching of the Oyl is called the Note.</p>
               <p>Your hawk is said to rowse, and not shake
herself.</p>
               <p>Sometime your hawk countenances, when
she picketh herself.</p>
               <p>Then shall you not say she pruneth herself,
but that she reformeth her feathers.</p>
               <p>Your hawk collieth, and not breaketh; your
hawk straineth, not clitcheth or snatcheth.</p>
               <p>She mantleth, and not stretcheth, when she
extendeth one of her wings along after her
leggs, and so the other.</p>
               <p>After she hath thus mantled herself, she cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
her wings together over her back, which
action you shall term the warbling of her wings
and say, she warbleth her wings.</p>
               <p>You shall say your hawk mutesheth or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
and not skliseth.</p>
               <p>You shall say cast your hawk to the Pearch,
and not set your hawk upon the Pearch.</p>
               <p>Furthermore you shall say, she is a fair, long,
short, thick hawk, and not a great hawk.</p>
               <p>Also you shall say, this hawk hath a large, or
a short beak, but call it not a bill.</p>
               <p>Also that your hawk is full gorged, and not
cropped.</p>
               <p>And that she hath a fine head, or a small head
well seasoned.</p>
               <p>You shall say, your hawk putteth over, and
endueth, but both of them in a divers kind.</p>
               <p>She putteth over, when she removeth her
meat from her gorge into her bowels, by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
with her body, but chiefly with her
neck, as a Crane or some other bird doth.</p>
               <p>She never endueth so long as her bowels be
full at her feeding; but as soon as she hath fed,
and resteth, she endueth by little and little.</p>
               <p>If her gorge be void, and her bowels any
thing stiff, then shall you say she is embowelled,
and hath not fully endued.</p>
               <p>So long as you find any thing in her bowels,
it is dangerous to give her meat.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>This bird (according to <hi>Vpton</hi>) doth
shew that he that first took upon him the
bearing thereof, was such an one as did ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
pursue, vex, and molest poor and silly
Creatures.</p>

               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>This bird (after his manner) is clamorous,
fraudulent, filching things away by stealth,
and hiding them secretly: Furthermore <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
saith, <hi>That Ravens do sometimes skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
amongst themselves with much eagerness,
and do assail each other with their armors,</hi> viz.
<hi>with jobbing with their bills, scratching with
their tallons, and beating with their wings:
in which conflict if the Hen do chance to have
the better of the Cock, she ever after holdeth
him in subjection.</hi> But howsoever they do cope
together in their encounter, certain it is that
the Victor ever after carrieth a hand over the
conquered.</p>

               <p>Hitherto of Fowls of prey, leaving other
particulars to each mans observation: Now
of those which are predable, whereof some

               <p>FROM Predable Fowls that are savage,
we come to Fowls domestical and home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
that are delighted with mans so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety:
Such are these that follow, with their
like.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>Like as there are Insect Animals that live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Earth, as hath been before shewed, in
shutting up the Tract of Terrestrial Animals:
so are there in like sort Insects that live above
the Earth, whereof I purpose to produce some
few Examples, and so to perclose this Treatise
of such Animals as do live above the Earth in
the Air.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>These small and slender bodies are indowed
with a perfect soul (if I may so say) as by the
effects appeareth: for they do not only live and
engender; but also have the use of the senses,
as sight, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
no less than other Volatiles or flying Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals;
and in some of them we may observe a
singular sharpness of wit, and (to speak with
<hi>Solomon</hi>) fulness of wisdome; as in these Bees
and such others. Great is the Lord therefore
that made them, and right marvellous also is
he in all his works, who hath given this ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of wisdome to these contemptible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>The Bee is reputed to be of a doubtful kind,
in regard that it is uncertain, whether he may
be fitly numbred amongst the savage or dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
kind of Animals; therefore they are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
his that hath obtained the possession of
them according to our vulgarspeech, <hi>Catch that
catch may.</hi> They are said to be <hi>ferae naturae:</hi>
therefore the Bees that do swarm on your trees,
until you have gathered them into an hive,
they are no more reckoned yours, than the
birds that do build their nests in your tree: but
being once hived, they cease to be publick, and
shall be adjudged the possessors, though he be
not interessed in the ground: and till then, it
is lawful for any man to take the Honycombs,
if they have any at all. Also a swarm escaped
out of your hives, is no longer reckoned yours
than you have them in sight, and it is lawful
for you so long to prosecute them; but if they
fly out of your sight, <hi>fiunt occupantis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Egyptians reckoned the Bee a figure of
Regal Power, because in him (besides the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of brute Animals) he is constituted a King,
that administreth his function (as it were) by
deep counsel, forasmuch as he is void of sting,
and governeth his hive, as his Commonwealth,
altogether by lenity.</p>
               <p>If a Bee sting a dead carkass, she loseth not
her sting; but if she sting a living man, she
loseth her sting. So death stinging us, who
were as dead flesh, did not lose his sting: But
stinging Christ, hath lost his sting. Therefore
we may say, <hi>O death where is thy sting, &amp;c.
1 Cor.</hi> 15. Death hath only the name of death,
but not the sting of death; as the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
in the Wilderness had the form and shape

               <p>HAVING finished our intended survey
of Animals, both Terrestrial and Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
and of their use in Armory; I will
now (according to order) proceed to the
handling of watery Animals, being such as have
their principal abode and relief in the waters;
as Fishes of all sorts. As fishes are of a less
compleat nature than earthly or aerial Animals,
so must they in reason be of less esteem in Coat-Armour,
<hi>Data paritate gestantium,</hi> unless
the quality of the Bearer add an honour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
because those others do approach much
nearer to the nature of man, than the watery
sort doth; <hi>Et illud est melius, quod optimo est
propinquius;</hi> That is the better, which comes
nearest to the best. And the Picture which is
the adumbration of the thing pictured, cannot
invert or alter the order or worth of the things
whereof it beareth the similitude, <hi>Quia fictio
non plus operatur quam veritas;</hi> representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
may not alter the truth of the principal.</p>
               <p>But here I speak of arms composed of fishes,
as they are considered in their self-nature;
which notwithstanding as they be born of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
persons descended of Noble and Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
are so much enoblished in their estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as that they are to be preferred before
many that are formed of beasts or fowls. This
therefore must be here also recommended for a
general Rule, That the worthiness of the
Bearer is not the least respect we should use in
considering the dignity of things born in Coat-Armour.</p>
               <p>Like as birds have their plumes, wings, and
trains, by means whereof they do cut their
way, and make smooth passage thorow the air;
in like sort fishes are furnished with fins, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they guide themselves in their swiming,
and cut the current of the streams and waves,
for their more easie passage, wherein their
course is directed by their tail, as ships are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
by their Helm or Ruther. And for their
kinds of motion, fishes are in Scripture term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Reptilia: In ipso magno mari &amp; spatioso,
illic reptilia sunt, &amp;c.</hi> In the great and wide
sea there are things creeping innumerable, both
small and great: which are therefore said to be
<hi>Reptilia,</hi> as <hi>Chassenus</hi> noteth, <hi>Quia omnia quae
natant reptandi habent vel speciem, velnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram:</hi>
because things when they swim seem to
creep along in the water.</p>
               <p>Fishes, albeit they have not breath (as we
may say in a comparative sort) so strong and
sensible as four-footed Animals have, because
they want Lungs or Lights, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath
taught, yet it behooveth they should have both
attraction and respiration of breath in some
fashion, which we call in Latin <hi>Inspiratio,</hi>
which is a drawing in of breath, and <hi>Respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio,</hi>
which is a venting out of the breath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
as both <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> do teach,
who do affirm that fishes do receive and deliver
their breath by their <hi>galls;</hi> For no longer is
any Animal said to have life, than he hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
and remission of breath.</p>
               <p>Whereas <hi>Moses</hi> maketh mention <hi>Gen. 2. 19,
20. That God caused all the beasts of the field,
and the fowls of heaven to come unto Adam,
that he might see how he would name them:</hi>
there is no mention of the coming of fishes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, neither that he gave names to them.
The reason is, for that such is the nature of
fishes, as that they cannot live long out of their
proper Element, which is the water. Besides
fishes do serve men for no other use, but for
food, and some sorts of them for medicine;
whereof it cometh, that we have not so many
names of fishes mentioned in the Scriptures, as
of other Animals. For these Reasons fishes
were not produced before <hi>Adam,</hi> that he might
give them Names answerable to their Natures:
Nevertheless God gave him dominion over
them, as well as over the rest, when he said
<hi>Dominamini piscibus maris, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereof it cometh, that man hath less familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and acquaintance with fishes than with
many other animals; as Horses, Doggs, small
Birds of many kinds, which we daily use, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to serve our necessities, or for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</p>
               <p>Fishes are born after a divers manner, <hi>viz.</hi>
directly upright, imbowed, extended, endor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
respecting each other, surmounting one
another, fretted, and trianguled, &amp;c. <hi>All fishes</hi>
(saith <hi>Leigh) that are born feeding, shall be
termed in blazon</hi> devouring, <hi>because they do
swallow all whole without mastication or
chewing: and you must tell whereon they feed.</hi>
All fishes raised directly upright, and having
fins, shall be termed in blazon <hi>Hauriant, ab
hauriendo,</hi> signifying to draw or suck; because
fishes do oftentimes put their heads in such sort
above the waters, to refresh themselves with
the cool and temperate air; but especially when
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55096:94"/>
the waters do so rage and boyl in the depth of
the seas against some tempestuous storm, that
they cannot endure the unwonted heat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
All fishes being born transverse, the Esco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon
must in blazon be termed Naiant, of
the word <hi>Nato,</hi> to swim; for in such manner
do they bear themselves in the waters when
they swim.</p>
               <p>Concerning both the variety and the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
multitude of fishes, <hi>Pliny</hi> is of a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
fantastical conceit, affirming that the seeds
and universal elements of the world are so
sundry ways commixed one with another, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the blowing of the winds, and partly by
the rowling and agitation of the sea, that it
may be truly said, according to the vulgar opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<hi>That whatsoever is ingendred or bred in
any part of the world besides, the same is to be
found in the sea; besides many things more in
it, which no where else are to be seen.</hi> A fish
(if you will believe <hi>Farnesius</hi>) is called <hi>piscis
a pascendo, Quia ad rem nullam nisi ad pastum
natus est;</hi> he is bred only to eat, and to be eaten.
Of fishes, some have hard and crusty coverings;
others have a softer outside: and those latter
are also of two sorts, some having only skin,
and others scales. Scaled fishes by their fins
are both adorned &amp; greatly assisted also in their
swiming: but Congers, Eels, Lampreys, and
such like, may seem (in respect of the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their fins) to have received them of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
rather for ornament than for use in swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
especially because they lye most in the
bottom of the waters, and therefore less need
their fins.</p>
               <p>Of these several kinds I will briefly give
some few Examples, wherein I rather purpose
to lay open their divers forms of bearing in
Coat-Armour, than meddle with their unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
particular kinds: as in Example.</p>

               <p>THE hardiness of scaly fish (whereof
we have before spoken) is not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate,

which is continuate; Of which sort some are

upon great reason, to shew the stedfast amity
and constant fidelity, that ought to be between
brethren and companions of one society and
brotherhood: For take one of these fishes, and
divide the shells, and endeavour to sort them
with (I will not say hundreds) but millions
of other shells of fishes of the same kind, and
you shall never match them throughout:
therefore do they resemble the indissoluble
friendship that ought to be in Fraternities and
Societies, because there can be according to
<hi>Cicero, Offic. 1. Nulla firma Amicitia nisi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

I be not deceived) moved the first Founders of
this Order to sort them in the collar of this
order by couples, for that all others do disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

               <p>WE have long insisted in the bearings
of Animals or living Creatures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
distinguishing them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their kinds, sorting them into seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ranks, placed them under sundry heads, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifying
their manifold use and forms of
bearing in Coat-Armour, to the end that they
might give better life and warrant to such
Rules and Observations, as concerning them
are formerly given. The last place I have here
reserved to the most noble Creature and first
in estimation, I mean Man, whom God hath
indued with a reasonable Soul, and for whose
sake he crcated all other things, subjecting
them to his sovereignty, that they should serve
man, and man should serve God. <hi>Thou hast
given him</hi> (saith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>sovereignty over all
the works of thy hands, and hast put all things
in subjection under his feet;</hi> all sheep and oxen,
and all beasts of the field, the fowls of the air
and fishes of the sea, &amp;c. For God made man
in his own image, not only in giving him an
understanding soul, and an holy will, but also a
sovereign jurisdiction over these inferiour crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
even as Kings are the Image of God, in
a more peculiar manner, because God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them sovereignty over men. Neither is
the beauty of the body it self lightly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
whose admirable proportions and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
made <hi>Galen</hi> (a heathen) to acknowledge
the infinite wisdome of an eternal Creator: And
that godly King to break out into terms of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
saying, <hi>Thine eyes did see my sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
yet being unperfect, and in thy book were
all my members written, which day by day
were fashioned, when as yet there was none of
them.</hi> Inasmuch as we are now come to treat
of man, the most excellent of all God's crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and for whose sake all things else were
created; let us take a considerate view of the
order of the Creation, and we shall find many
forcible motives to stir us up to the glorifying
of our gracious God, that hath so graciously
and abundantly provided for our sustentation
and maintenance before we were yet created:
that so we may be provoked with more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
and regard to meditate upon Gods ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Omnipotency, Mercy, and gracious
Providence; and be induced more regardfully
to ponder and consider the inexplicable glory
of the heavens, and their most beautiful orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the fruitfulness and riches of the earth,
the infinite variety of shapes, colours, qualities,
and operations of Animals and Vegetables; of
all which there is not the least, or whatsoever
we hold most contemptible, but will minister
unto us just cause to glorifie God's Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Mercy, and Wisdome.</p>

God hath created man, and placed him in this
world, to the end he should be a diligent search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
viewer, and beholder of all his works; and
withal, that he should not be only a Spectator,
but also a serious and zealous Enarrator of his
infinite wisdome, power, and mercy, in that
he hath most powerfully created them, most
wisely disposed them, and most providently
conserveth them in their several ranks and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
places and offices.</p>
               <p>But when we speak of man, we must not
understand him to be that outward form or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments
of body, that is subjected to our visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sense; but the mind of each man is the man
indeed, not that part of him that may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
by pointing of the finger.</p>
               <p>The mind of man penetrateth and passeth
through all things in a moment, more swiftly
than the stars, more speedily than imagination,
yea with more celerity than time it self.</p>
               <p>So great is the estate and dignity of mans
condition and nature, as that there is no good
can suffice him, but the chiefest and only good
of all.</p>
               <p>The soul of man is of a Divine Nature, and
therefore immortal and eternal; he ascendeth
up by degrees evermore, and never ceaseth
until he attain divine and celestial things:
Which nature and property is not found in any
creature but in man only.</p>
               <p>God indeed hath created man of an upright
stature, with his countenance raised up towards
heaven; whereas he hath given all other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
a groveling countenance, fixed upon the
earth: whereby he would notifie, that mans
soul is a celestial thing, and that his <hi>ultimum
bonum</hi> is in heaven; that heaven is his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
that there is his everlasting habitation,
if he love his God, and become pliant and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient

               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> calleth man <hi>the miracle of God; for,</hi>
saith he, <hi>man is endued with the force of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the World.</hi> For what is the world, but
an universality of things compacted together
in the form of a Sphere? And what is man, but
a Compendium or Epitome of the universality
of things? Therefore was he not mis-named
by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> when he called him <hi>a little world:</hi>
For he understandeth with the Angels, he hath
sense with living Creatures, he communicateth
of food, growth and generation with Plants;
and finally he hath being with all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and retaineth with the world the form
of a Sphere. For as <hi>Iulius Solinus</hi> saith, <hi>look
how much breadth a man hath when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
his hands to the full, so much is his
length from the crown to the heel:</hi> So as if you
draw a circle about him, you shall comprehend
him within the form of a compas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed Sphere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> speaking of the particular works of
God in his Creation before he had created man,
saith, <hi>Ea visa fuisse Deo bona;</hi> but after he
had created man, and all things pertaining to
his sustentation and preservation, as also all
things behoveful for the propagation of all
mankind prepared, then did he take a general
view and survey of the whole fabrick of the
World, <hi>Et Deo visum fuisse valde bonum,</hi> they
were exceeding, that is, so perfect good in the
highest degree, as nothing could be wished to
be added thereto for the bettering thereof.</p>
               <p>As touching the food allotted to man, at the
first it is most certain, that the same was herbs
and fruits, as appeareth <hi>Gen. 1. 29. Ecce dedi
vobis omnem herbam, &amp;c. And God said, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
I have given unto you every herb bearing
seed, which is upon all the earth; and every
tree, wherein is the fruit of a tree bearing
seed, that shall be to you for meat.</hi> That is to
say (saith <hi>Zanchius</hi>) <hi>multam, amplissimam,
suavissimam &amp; utilissimam,</hi> in great plenty,
abundant, most delicate and most wholsome;
herewith shall ye be satisfied and contented
without seeking after other food.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These three things (<hi>saith</hi> Zanchius) are
most certain; first, that before the flood both
herbs and fruits of trees were so wholsome and
good, as that man needed no other food; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
whereof there was no need, that the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of flesh should be permitted unto him. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
it is also undoubtedly true, that after
the flood the earth was so corrupted by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation
thereof, and consequently mans body
became so weakened, that he stood in need of
more solid and strong nourishing meats, as the
flesh of Oxen, Kine, Sheep, &amp;c. In regard
whereof God gave him permission to use them
for food. Thirdly, this also is without all
controversie, that God did not prohibit unto man
any sorts of meats, because <hi>all things are clean
to the clean:</hi> as also <hi>for that every Creature
of God is good, because they are sanctified by
his Word.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the mixture and composition of the four
Elements before mentioned, and of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
of them, and of them engendred, two
principal parts of matters of our bodies have
their being, <hi>viz.</hi> our bones with their nerves
or sinews, wherewith they be conjoyned and
knit; and our flesh with the veins, whereby
the blood is conveyed throughout all parts of
the body, together with her arteries, whereby
the vital and animal spirits are carried into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part and member thereof.</p>
               <p>These two parts did <hi>Adam</hi> well express,
when speaking of <hi>Eve</hi> he said, <hi>Haec est os ex
ossibus meis, &amp; caro de carne mea.</hi> First he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
mention of bone, as the more solid and
substantial part, and as it were the fundamental
part of the whole body; and after of the flesh,
as of the matter wherewith the bones are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:55096:98"/>
To these two parts there is annexed a skin,
wherewith the whole frame of the body (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
united and knit together) is covered, and
wherein it is comprehended and contained.
And this skin is not scaly, such as is proper to
fishes; neither feathered after the manner of
fowls; neither hairy and rugged, as many sorts
of beasts are; neither thick skinned, as many
bruit Animals have; but a soft tender skin, and
of a delicate touch, and such as may well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seem
such a mind, as the mind of man is: for
where there is store of wit, there needeth not
a hard skin, but a soft tender skin fitteth best
a generous and ingenious mind. For so was
it the pleasure of the most wise God, to adde
unto the noblest mind the noblest flesh, and the
tenderest and most dainty skin, that so the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
shape might be an evident testimony of
the inward mind. That this Creature, Man,
is also born in Coat-Armour both limb-meal (as
I may term it) and also entire, with all his
parts conjunct, I will shew by Examples: and
we will first here set down the whole bearings,
and afterward proceed to the parts.</p>

               <p>In the workmanship of this principal mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of mans body may we behold with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
the unspeakable power, providence, and
mercy of God, if we shall attentively consider
the order and composition of the head, with
the external and internal parts thereof.</p>
               <p>First of all the skull, called in Latin <hi>Cranium,</hi>
is the uppermost bone of the head, fashioned
in the form of a Globe, and distinguished with
their orders of small holes and seams. An
Example of hearing in Coat-Armour of three
of these skuls on a Cheveron I have formerly
given you, <hi>pag.</hi> 114. where I treated of bones.
The skull is outwardly covered with skin and
thin flesh, lest the same should be overburthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with too much weight. This flesh with that
skin is therefore made full of pores, or small
invisible holes, for the more commdious eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration
of the gross humours of the brain,
and certain excrements thereof; whereof
hairs are engendred and may have their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.
The skull is inwardly hollow, to the end
that the brain, which is the seat of all the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
might be the more commodiously confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
therein.</p>
               <p>The skull hath God distributed into three
parts, <hi>viz.</hi> into <hi>Sinciput,</hi> which is the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
thereof, and conjoyneth to the forehead;
into <hi>Occiput,</hi> which is the hindmost part
thereof; and into <hi>Verticem,</hi> which is the
Crown or middle part of the same, seated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the fore and hinder part aforenamed.</p>
               <p>Under these three partitions are placed three
several faculties: In the forepart is the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie,
or <hi>Sensus Communis, scil.</hi> the Judgment
of the Senses, or universal notion of things;
in the middle the Imagination; and Memory
in the hinder part of the head.</p>
               <p>Within the concavity of the skull the brain
hath his being, distinguished with 3 little Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles
or Cells, one in the forepart, another in
the midst, and the last in the hinder part: In
which three Ventricles, the forms and ideas of
things, apprehended by the exterior senses, are
severally and distinctly imprinted. Therefore to
the end the same might be more effectually
performed, God made not the brain fluent, like
water, for then would it not apprehend or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
those conceited forms; nor yet of solid
substance, like bones, for then could it not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
admit the impressions of such imaginary
forms: but he made the brain of an indifferent
temper, <hi>viz.</hi> moderately soft, and moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hard, to wit, of a soft and temperate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, God hath made in the brains
of man certain concavities or hollownesses, and
those hath he replenished with vital spirits,
without which the interiour senses could not
consist: and these spirits doth the soul use to
understand by, and to the performance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
actions which she produceth in the head.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in the brain hath he placed the
fountain of the sinews, which from thence are
dispersedly conveyed throughout the body; as
well those nerves and sinews as are sensitive, as
also those that are motive, <hi>viz.</hi> those that give
motion to the body. But who can express or
conceive in mind the manifold instruments of
the soul, that God hath placed in the head of
man?</p>
               <p>In the head we may observe (well-nigh)
all the uses of the soul. Behold the admirable
composition of mans head, which of all other
parts of the body is the noblest; and how all
and singular the parts thereof are accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and applied by our most gracious Maker,
Conserver, and Redeemer, to serve for the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of all the faculties of the soul!</p>
               <p>If the framing of this one member (I mean
the head of a man) be so admirable in it self;
how much more is the composition of the
whole frame of the body, being conjoyned and
united together with sinews and arteries, in a
proportionable manner, and furnished through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
with all the external and internal parts,
and their particular appurtenances to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?</p>
               <p>The members of Animals are (of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers)
usually distinguished into external and
internal, and so be handled severally each one
apart by it self: but I labouring to be brief
herein, will handle those outward and inward
parts only, whose shapes and forms I find to be
born in Coat-Armour, leaving the more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and exact handling of them to the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of Physicians, Chirurgions, and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomists
professed, to whose consideration they
do more properly appertain.</p>
               <p>The head in Latin is called <hi>Caput,</hi> because
it is the chief and principal beginning of the
whole fabrick of the body, and withal the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
of all other the members thereof.</p>
               <p>In the head do the two principal faculties of
the sould rest, <hi>viz.</hi> the Intelligent and Sentient,
and do there execute their functions, albeit that
the vegetable faculty also hath his operation
there, but the other two do reign and chiefly
predominate therein: therefore it is the seat
and residence of all the senses, as well internal
as external, placed in the head, and that for
good cause; for since that the faculty Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
understandeth not in any other sort than
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55096:99"/>
by inspection of imagination and imaginary
shapes, which are engendred of external forms,
and are by the outward senses conveyed to the
phantasie or image conceived in the mind. Most
wisely therefore hath God there placed the seat
and wisdome of all the senses, where the mind
hath her being, that so she need not go farr to
seek those imaginary forms whereof she is to
consider, to understand and dispose of accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to order.</p>
               <p>Therefore inasmuch as the senses are become
serviceable to the mind, there the seat or resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the senses is most fitly placed, where
the mind doth exercise her offices and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>From the same head do proceed all the
nerves and sinews wherewith each bone and
member, as also the universal body is conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and fastened together, and consolidated,
and also receiveth increase, and being. In the
head is placed the principal part of manly form,
the Visage, whereby the differeth from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Animals, and doth far surpass them in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and comliness; whereof the Poet rightly

Forasmuch as God would that the faculties,
both intelligent and sentient, should predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in the head; therefore did he form and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
therein instruments well fitting for
either use: Of these instruments there are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
two sorts, whereof the first containeth the
instruments of the inferiour senses, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the outward.</p>
               <p>The instruments serving for the use of the
external senses (whereof there is use in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory)
are not many; therefore will I handle
them as I shall find use of them in Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour:
the rest I will only name, and so pass
them over as impertinent to my purpose. These
instruments of the external senses are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
five, that is to say, the eyes, nostrils, ears,
mouth, with the roof and palate thereof, and
the tongue. Of these I find only the eyes born
in Coat-Armour, therefore of them only will
I treat something in their due place, as those
that are best known to use.</p>

               <p>God hath annexed those two nerves or si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news,
as the Wagons of the shapes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblances
received into the eyes, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to the phantasie: which sinews, albeit
there are two of them annexed to each eye,
nevertheless, when they are protracted to the
brain, they do joyn together and end in one
point, for this end and purpose, that the shapes
that were twofold in the two eyes, they should
yet end in one, forasmuch as the conceived
shapes are simply of one colour, and that so
the Judge of the <hi>Sensus communis;</hi> or the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie
should not be deceived.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, he hath covered the eyes with
lids, as it were with folding doors, both for
a defence against harmful objects, and more
specially for sleep, that these being shut, man
might take his rest and sleep.</p>
               <p>These are the means and instruments of
sight, that is to say, of the eyes, whereof
who can attain the knowledge of the exact
workmanship of them?</p>
               <p>The rest of the beforementioned external
instruments, <hi>viz.</hi> the Nose, Ears, Mouth, with
the Roof and Palate thereof, and the Tongue,
I do pass them over, as not being of any, or
(at the least) frequent use in Armory, but as
they are parts of the head, and therewith uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and conjoyned. After the head and parts
thereof, the heart doth challenge the chiefest
place, as in Example.</p>

               <p>In the actions and gestures of the body, of
all the members thereof the hand is (as I may
say) the most talkative: For it is a usual thing
with the most sort of men, by the motion of
the right hand to crave silence; when we make
any speech or protestation of our selves, we
do clap our hands upon our breasts; when we
are moved with admiration, we strike our hand
upon our thigh; with the hand we do becken
and allure unto us, and therewith we do repell
and put from us; when we speak to other men,
we do extend our hands toward them. The
apposition of the finger to the mouth, is a note
of silence craved; the striking of the breast
with the fist, is a token of sorrow and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
the exalting and shaking of the right
hand aloft, is usual with military persons
when they will notifie any prosperous suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</p>
               <p>The hand, as it is comly in sight, so is it also
of singular use, and an Instrument of many
Arts: for by their help there is no invention of
mans wit left unattempted and brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
and therefore it is of all other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of mans body, the nimblest and most uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal:
yet is the same no longer reckoned a
part of man, than it can perform her function,
as witnesseth <hi>Aristole Metaph. Manus non sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
est pars hominis, nisi quando potest perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
opus suum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The clapping of hands is a token of joy and
applause, and hath been in use not only with
men of modern times, when they would signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their consent and approbation; but also with
those of ancient time, as we may see when
<hi>Iehojada</hi> the Priest caused <hi>Ioash</hi> the Son of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haziah</hi>
to be crowned King; <hi>Then he brought
out the King's Son, and put the Crown upon
him, and gave him the Testimony, and they
made him King, and anointed him, and they
clapt their hands, and said, God save the
King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anciently the cutting off hands and feet
was used for a military punishment, for such
as had committed some capital crime meriting
death. So we read that <hi>Aufidius Cassius,</hi> by
a new and unexperimented Example, did pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
divers fugitive Souldiers that had abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Captain, by cutting off their hands
and feet, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>irming that such punishment was
more exemplary and disciplinable than the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of them to death, by how much a long
and lingering reproachful life is worse than
death it self, that giveth a speedy end to all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
and wretched calamities.</p>
               <p>It hath been an ancient custome, that when
a Master requireth his servant to perform for
him any matter of importance (and would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
him by taking of a solemn Oath to use his
best care and diligence for the effectual accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing
thereof) to cause his servant to put his
hand under his thigh, and to take his Oath, as
we may see <hi>Gen. 24. 2, 3. Put now thy hand
under my thigh, and I will make thee swear
by the Lord, the God of Heaven, and the God
of Earth, that thou shalt not take a wife un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Son of the Daughters of the Canaanites
amongst whom I dwell.</hi> This Ceremony shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Servants Obedience to his Master, and
the Masters power over the Servant.</p>

drought in their Breasts, like the Gout that
haunteth the rich and wealthy only. By the
Teats sometimes are meant the plentiful Fields
wherewith men are nourished; as we may read
<hi>Isai. 32. 12. Men shall lament for the teats,
even the pleasant fields, and for the fruitful
vines.</hi> Like as wholsome and plentiful feeding
nourisheth and encreaseth milk: so contrariwise
thin diet, sorrow, and grief of mind or sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

               <p>The Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> shewing the untoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

against the prescript of Nature's Order. Of
which prodigious kinds of Beasts, as some have
been procreated by means of mans idle inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

there sundry sorts of Beasts no less unnaturally
ingendred, through careless neglect of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating

by permitting the Beasts of distinct kinds to
sort and feed together confusedly in the time of

Animals much more prodigious than all
the former; such are those Creatures
formed, or rather deformed, with the confused

These (according to some Authors) are
called in Latin <hi>Monstra à Monstrando,</hi> for

If man had not transgressed the Law

               <p>Azure, a Griffon sergreant or rampant, Or,
is the Coat of Sir <hi>Iohn Read</hi> of <hi>Brocket-hall</hi>
in <hi>Hartfordshire,</hi> Baronet. As also by the
Name of <hi>Cursellis;</hi> and by Mr. <hi>Iames Cursellis</hi>
of <hi>London,</hi> Merchant.</p>
               <p>Sable, a Griffon sergreant, Or, is the Coat
of the Honourable Society of <hi>Grays-Inn,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of the four Inns of Court. The erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the fore-leggs of this Griffon is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
testimony of his readiness for action,
which addeth a second force of his attempt, and
promiseth a successful event of his enterprise,
by reason he uniteth force and industry toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The Griffon having attained his full
growth, will never be taken alive; wherein
he doth adumbrate, or rather lively set forth
the property of a valorous Souldier, whose
magnanimity is such, as he had rather expose
himself to all dangers, and even to death it self,
than to become a Captive.</p>

Bear, Griffon, or whatsoever other Animal of
fierce nature (as aforesaid) that is shaped in
like form and action: For the Lion is not said
to be rampant, because he representeth the
shape of a Lion, but in respect of his fierce and
cruel action; so this in like manner using the
same actions, may apertly participate the same
terms of blazon, his double shape notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

               <p>UNTO this will I add some sorts of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals,
which although they be duly
shaped, and therefore may seem to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with those of the same kind formerly
treated of, yet do they much differ from them,
either in their unnatural postures and gestures;
or else being with some liberty-debarring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
by mans industry and invention re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
of their natural freedom, as by a chain,
or the like; and therefore could not, according
to Methods strict rule, have been handled pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously
among the former. Some few Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of this kind of bearing of Animals of
this sort in Coat-Armour, I here present unto
your view.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Argent, a Lion ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant,
regardant, Sable, is
the Coat of <hi>Thomas Mathew of Castle-Mengch</hi>
in <hi>Glamorganshire,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr>
               </p>
               <p>Or, a Lion rampant, regardant, Sable, is born
by <hi>Iohn Lloyd</hi> of <hi>Keyswyn</hi> in <hi>Merionethshire,</hi>
Esq.</p>
               <p>This action doth manifest an inward and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
perturbation of the mind, which is
meerly repugnant to the most couragious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Lion, <hi>Cujus natura est imperterrita,</hi>
according to the saying, <hi>Leo fortissimus bestia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
ad nullius pavebit occursum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The form of bearing of the Lion regardant,
albeit in respect of his courage and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
it be contrary to his natural quality, for
that it may be thought, and is indeed general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
holden to be a chief note of timorousness,
which is meerly contrary to his generous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
yet nevertheless it is good Armory, not
only in him, but also in all other Animals of
like bearing, so long as they are born signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly;
and it fitteth our profession to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
all sorts of bearing to the best, that is to
say, to the most honour of their Bearers. To
the end therefore that I may give some satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
touching the commendable bearing
thereof to such as do hold the contrary, I
hold the same form of bearing to be born (not
only in the Lion, but in whatsoever other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals)
significantly, and therefore commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly:
forasmuch as such action betokeneth a
diligent circumspection or regardful considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of fore-passed events of things, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55096:105"/>
of them with things present, that he
may give a conjectural ghess of the effects of
things yet to come, and resting in deliberation,
which proprieties are peculiar to men that are
careful and considerate of such businesses as they
do undertake.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Other sorts of bearing of Animals there be,
whose natural actions are hindred by reason of
the apposition of certain Artificial Impediments;
as shall appear hereafter in these next following
<hi>Escocheons.</hi>
               </p>
               <figure/>
               <p>No Beast can be truly said to be free that is
tied about the neck, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> observeth,
saying, <hi>Nullum animal tunc est liberum, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
collum suum vinculis habet solutum.</hi>

               <p>In the closing up of this third Section of Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational
Animals, I will note unto you some
few Examples (not unworthy your observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
of some other sorts of bearing than have
been hitherto spoken of; for that I would not
willingly omit any thing worthy of note, that
may serve for your better information: For I
had rather you were ill furnished at my hands,
than that I should leave you altogether disfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.
The things that I purpose to note un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you in this place, are briefly these, to wit,
That there are some Coat-Armours, whose
Fields (besides their grand Charge) do admit
some petite Charge to be annexed to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Charge. Others there are, wherein the
Field being freed of such petty Charges, the
same are imposed upon the Charge it self. Hence
it is, that we have so many Lions and other
living things born Gutte, Billette, Escalloppe,
Pellette, &amp;c. as by this that ensueth in part
may be seen.</p>

OF
HERALDRY.</head>
               <head>SECT. IV. CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>AS all Natural things (of which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
we have intreated) were
made by the powerful hand of the
Almighty and All-wise God for
the use of Mankind: so did God
also endue Man with an admirable power infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
into him, with a reasonable Soul, whereby
every man might invent ways and means to
help himself, and one man to help another by
the benefit of Arts, for the better use of those
things which God and Nature hath provided.
In which respects Art is reputed <hi>Naturae Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi>
Natures Ape, for imitating those things
which Nature herself hath framed, as we see
in Painting, Poetry, and the like. But we may
go further (since Art goeth further) and add,
That Art is also <hi>Natura Obstetrix, Medica,
Leno:</hi> Natures Midwife, in helping her for the
safer and better producing of her fruits, as is
Husbandry, &amp;c. Natures Physician, in preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Natures works, as Architecture, Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and Physick it self: Lastly, Art is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Pandor, in setting her out to the most
tempting and pleasing fashion, by inventing
those things that tend either to the adorning
or delight, so to please the senses and phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
with those things, which in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
without Art, would not be so contentful.
And therefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> yieldeth this reason of
the invention of Arts, <hi>Quia Natura multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer
est ancilla &amp; multis angustiis oppressa, idea
inventa est Ars, ut suppleat defectum Naturae,</hi>
Nature is much kept under and oppressed like
an Handmaid, and therefore Arts were invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to supply those defects of Nature.</p>
               <p>In this place therefore we intend from the
works of Nature to come to the works of Art,
so far forth as they are used in Coat-Armour.
And here we must be born with, if we use the
word of Art in his largest signification, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all Sciences and Knowledge, whether Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative
or Operative and Pratick whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
for so one hath defined it, <hi>Art is the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of doing or teaching any thing by certain
Rules</hi> [or prescript forms:] And therefore
some have thought Arts to be <hi>ab Arctando,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55096:108"/>
Quia arctis brevibusque praeceptis concluditur,</hi>
because it is comprised in brief and compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Precepts: whereas those who so call it,
<hi>quia per Artus operatur,</hi> for the works of the
limbs or joynts, they comprehend only Arts
Mechanical by that name. Some more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
derive it from the Greek word <hi>Arete,</hi> which
signifieth Vertue; because the perfect Skill or
Art of doing any thing is properly the vertue
of that Action. In handling these Artificials,
I will follow our prescribed Order, and begin
with the Ensigns of the Actions of Estate Civil,
and first with the Highest and Sovereign, as in
Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>The Kings Crown is arched, to shew its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency
to the Imperial Heaven; its adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with precious stones, as it were with stars,
to represent its splendor; and its being lined
with furrs doth declare its honour.</p>
               <p>The cause that moved the Egyptians to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
a Crown amongst their Sacred or Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphical
Letters, may not impertinently be
expressed in this place, where we are to handle
their divers forms according to the several Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
and Estates, to whom they do appertain:
For as Gamesters make but cold sport, when
there is no money at stake; so knowledge doth
oftentimes faint, if it be not seasoned with the
Salt of Reason. In this Hieroglyphick we may
observe the four causes of the Law: The effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
cause is understood by the Head of the
King that is adorned with this Crown. The
final cause is conceived by the Flowers, or by
the profitable use of fruit; which how great
the same (in likelyhood) will be, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured
by the Flowers. The material cause
may be gathered by the context or interlaced
form and workmanship of the Crown, which
carrieth a resemblance of the People or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
Finally, by the Orbicular form of the
Crown is understood Justice; and amongst Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians
the Spherical form is reckoned
the perfectest and most noble, <hi>Farnes.</hi> 3. 65.</p>
               <p>The Prince is to the People the Author of all
goodness; inasmuch as from him, as from a
plentiful Fountain, doth flow a sweet current
of plentiful streams of honour, profit and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
In regard whereof he is reputed to be
the Common Parent of all his Subjects, in that
he affordeth unto them whatsoever a Natural
Parent oweth to his Children. The platting
of these Flowers in the Crown doth represent
the end of the Law, which end hath its deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
period in utility, <hi>Farnes.</hi> 4. 66. For
that Tree which beareth no blossoms, for the
most part produceth no fruit at all, <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crowns in times past have been of great
value, and sumptuously enriched with precious
stones, as we may read</hi> 1. Chro. 20. 2. And
<hi>David</hi> took the Crown of their King from off
his head, and found it to weigh a Talent of
Gold, and there were precious stones in it. And
it was set on <hi>David's</hi> head.</p>
               <p>In these latter Ages the Emperour elected
(before his Coronation) doth write himself
<hi>King of the Romans,</hi> as a title of less esteem
and dignity than is the Title of Emperour.
But in ancient times the Romans had three
degrees of Supream Dignity; that is to say,
a King, a Dictator, an Emperour; and of these
the Dignity of a King was the chiefest; and
next thereto the Dignity of a Dictator was
holden the worthiest; and after the Dictator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Estate of an Emperour held the third
place, as inferiour to both the other. Hereof
we have a manifest proof, in that the Senate
and People of <hi>Rome</hi> minding to give unto <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi>
the Emperour (being a man well deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55096:108"/>
of them) some advancement or increase
of honour and dignity, they purposed to make
him Dictator, which he (reverently bowing
his knee) refused, for that he reputed the same
a Dignity more ambitious, and of greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem,
and withal more subjected to spite and
envy, esteeming the Title of Emperour to
be popular, and of small account, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the eminency of a Dictatorship. We
may easily perceive by this<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>
(that time he was Dictator) did affect to aspire
to the Dignity of a King, for which cause he
was slain: forasmuch as the Citizens could not
endure that he should exercise Royal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
over them; but well could they suffer him to
use the power of a Dictator as a Jurisdiction of
less esteem <hi>Leonard. Aretini Epistolar. Lib.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>There can be but one King at one time in a
Realm, whose Power must be absolute, for the
better managing of the Estate and Affairs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
for if there be more, they will cross and
hinder each other in his Government, and
so destroy the nature of a King, in that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them can sway the whole weale
publick, but each of them should admit a
participation in government. This do both
ancient and modern times manifest unto
us by Examples: For neither <hi>Numa,</hi> nor
<hi>Hostilius,</hi> nor <hi>Ancus Martius,</hi> nor any other
of succeeding Kings of the Romans, could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
any Fellow or Copartner in Government.
The like also may we observe in Kings of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
times: for neither doth <hi>England</hi> nor
<hi>France</hi> admit more than one King at once to
sway the Sovereign State, but one alone hath
the sole Government: So that it is a thing
meerly repugnant to the Nature of Royal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
that two Persons at one time should
exercise Kingly Authority.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>It is in your choice whether you will term
the foresaid Crowns Or, or not; for it sufficeth
only to mention their Form, because it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to them to be made of Gold: But when
they are found to be born in other kind of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
or Colours, you should in blazoning make
mention whereof they are.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>A Scepter (with many Nations) is holden
for an especial Ensign of Royal Jurisdiction and
Authority, and the extending thereof a special
note of the placability and royal favour of the
King; as we may see <hi>Hester 15. 14. And he
held up his golden Scepter, and laid it upon
her Neck.</hi> That the Scepter betokeneth Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
and Authority, it is manifest by that
which is written, <hi>Baruch 6. 13. One holdeth
a Scepter, as if he were a Iudge of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
yet can he not slay such as offend him:</hi>
which is here spoken of the vanity of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols
before mentioned in the same Chapter;
<hi>Now shall you see in</hi> Babylon <hi>Gods of Silver
and of Gold, and of Wood, born upon mens
shoulders to cause them to fear.</hi>

for a declaration of the Royal Majesty or Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of an Emperour and King, and are worn
by the persons themselves that do exercise So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign

honour, appeareth by many evident testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies

found by experience that God had bestowed
upon him gifts worthy to be highly honoured)
put upon his finger a Ring, and about his neck
a Chain of Gold; <hi>Detrahens Pharaoh</hi> (saith

they were bestowed for Rewards upon such as
were of the Blood Royal of Kings, or such as
were near of Alliance unto them, as appeareth

Rings on their fingers so much for ornament

that the Seal gave a better approbation than
the writing did, concerning the validity and

men used to fortifie their last Wills and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

               <p>WE now come to Coat-Armours beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening
or borrowed from the Arts
Liberal; which (according to <hi>Ioh.
de Tur. Cremat.</hi>) are so denominated for three
respects: First, <hi>Quia liberam mentem requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,</hi>
to put a difference between them, and
those Mechanical Sciences wherein Artificers do
more exercise their limbs than their minds. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
they are called Liberal, in regard they
are attained without any impeachment of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
or cauterize of Conscience. Thirdly, for
that in times past, only the Children of noble
and free-born persons were admitted to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
and trained up in them. <hi>Patricius</hi>
saith that Arts Liberal are so termed, <hi>Quia
liberos homines efficiunt ab omni turpi &amp; sordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
questu, &amp;c.</hi> Because they make men to be of
liberal and ingenuous minds, free from base
and sordid covetousness and sensual delights,
ennobling them with true wisdome (the most
noble endowment of mankind) wherby men are
as it were link'd unto God, and made most like
unto him.</p>
               <p>And this especially is effected by that high
and heavenly Art, Theology, a Science not
invented by man, but proceeding from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Wisdom of the Almighty, whereunto all
other Arts are but Handmaids; in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the Professors thereof are by right, and
also by common consent of best approved He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds,
to have the precedency of all worldly
Professions whatsoever. And this Celestial
Science tending to the eternal happiness of the
Soul, is accompanied with two other Faculties
of great esteem (though inferiour to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer)
which are <hi>Physick</hi> and <hi>Law;</hi> the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
the good of our Body (and therefore
worthily to have the next place after our Souls)
the other tending to our outward Estates of
Fortune, which are not to be neglected of the
wisest. And these three we call the Cardinal
Sciences, because of their great necessity and
noble use above the other seven Liberal Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
               <p>Man naturally desireth knowledge, but is
not able to attain the perfection thereof, no
though he be well read in Natural Histories, in
Chronography and Moral Discipline, as may
be seen <hi>Ecclesiast. 1. 13. And I gave my heart
to seek, and search out by wisdome, concerning
all things that are done under the heavens:
this sore travel hath God given to the son of
man, to be exercised therewith, and all is
but vexation of the spirit. For in much wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is much grief, and he that increaseth
knowledge increaseth sorrow, verse 18. And
further, by these, my son, be admonished, of
making many Books there is no end, and much
study is a weariness of the flesh.</hi> Whereby we
are given to understand, that wisdome and
knowledge are not gotten without great travel
of body and mind; and when a man hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to the highest pitch, yet is his mind ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fully satisfied; wherefore we must depend
only upon God, and acknowledge that there is
no true felicity in this life. One Example I
will give you, which shall comprehend all the
Liberal Sciences joyntly, which is this next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

               <p>It is a custome with many men that are slow
or dull of apprehension, when they set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to write of any serious matter, long to
deliberate with themselves, how they may
best contrive the same, and during all the time
of their meditation, to gnaw or bite their pen,
whereupon it seemeth the Proverb grew, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandere
Calamum,</hi> which may be applied to
them that bestow much time, and take great
pains to accomplish that they undertake.

               <p>Of demonstrable Examples of Instruments
pertaining to the Arts Liberal, the number is
not great, unless it be of such as do peculiarly
pertain to the Art of Musick. As touching the
rest, either they have no material Instruments
at all, for that their attaining and exercise are
altogether in Discipline and Instructions by
speech only; as Grammar, Logick, Rhetorick,
&amp;c. Or if they have Instruments, they are
such as are common with them to other Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
as the Rule and Compass, &amp;c. whereof
the Carpenter and Mason have use as well as
the Geometrician. As for Globes, Spheres,
Quadrants, and other Astronomical Instruments
I find them not usual in Coat-Armour; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I let them pass. The Musical Instruments
are of three sorts, whereof some are Wind-Instruments,
as are the Organs, Shagbuts, How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys,
Cornets, Flutes, &amp;c. The second sort
consisteth in strings, and in the skilfull fingring
of them; as are Harps, Viols, Rebecks, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals,
Claricords, Bandore, Alpharion, Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,
&amp;c. The third sort consisteth in striking;

Kettle-Drums, and such others, whereof in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

               <p>THOUGH great be the difference of
dignity and esteem betwixt the Noble
and Liberal Professions (before intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of) and those other which we call Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
and Illiberal; because those are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of divine spirits and understanding minds,
whereas these are for the most part but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
of an industrious hand: yet in these
also, as there is great use for the necessity of
mans life, so is there much reputation for the
exquisite varieties of invention. And albeit
they are called Illiberal, <hi>Quia liberè exerceri
non possunt, sine corporis viribus,</hi> because they
cannot be freely practised without bodily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
yet in another respect they may be more
truly called Liberal than the Liberal Sciences
themselves, for that commonly they bestow
more wealth on their Professors, whiles, as
<hi>Virtus,</hi> so <hi>Scientia laudatur &amp; alget.</hi> In the
first rank of these Illiberals reason exacts that
Agriculture should have precedence, it being
the chief Nurse of mans life, and hath in the
times of the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> been esteemed an
estate not unbefitting their greatest Dictators
and Princes: and it was devised and put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
soon after the Creation, as appeareth in
the Text, where it is said, <hi>Habel Pastor Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis,
Kaiin verò Agricola;</hi> for here we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not only Tillage, but also Pastorage, Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and all kind of increase of Beasts, or
fruits for Food, under this Name of Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry.</p>
               <p>After the Deluge God made a Covenant
with <hi>Noah,</hi> that from thenceforth he would
never destroy mankind by water, as hath been
before touched: but that his first Ordinance
concerning the fourfold seasons of the year
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55096:114"/>
should remain inviolable unto the Worlds end;
In assurance of this same infallible promise of
God, we do fit ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> actions according to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

and <hi>dunging</hi> of our Land, in <hi>planting,
pruning,</hi> and such like.</p>
               <p>That Tillage and Husbandry was the first of
all the Mechanical Trades (as we now call
them) it is manifest, <hi>Gen. 2. 15. Then the Lord
God took the man, and put him into the Garden
of</hi> Eden, <hi>that he might dress it, and keep it.
Wherein</hi> (saith <hi>Zanch.) God would moderate
the pleasure and delight that he had given to</hi>
Adam, <hi>in some kind of Trade or course of life,
and honest Exercise. Whereof Tillage is of
all other the most ancient and commendable,
inasmuch as it was instituted in Paradise, and
that in the time of mans innocency before he
had transgressed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a great difference between the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry
that man was initiated unto before his
fall, and after: For after his transgression it
was performed with much labour, pain, and
sweat, and to supply necessity, such as is the
Husbandry now used; For Husbandmen be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to till the ground, if they will have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to sustain life. Therefore God said <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledicta
terra propter te, &amp;c. Cursed be the earth
for thy sake: In sudore vultus comedes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
In the sweat of thy brows shalt thou eat of it
all the days of thy life, Gen. 3. 17. Thorns
also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and
thou shalt eat the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rb of the field, verse</hi> 18.
Before <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall he was injoyned to till the
ground only to prevent idleness; such as is the
Husbandry that Noblemen are delighted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and do perform the same with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
               <p>There is a kind of Tillage much differing
from this, whereof <hi>Petrarch</hi> saith, <hi>Ager est
animus, cultus intentio; semen cura, messis la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

capies;</hi> The mind is the field, intention
the tillage, care the seed, labour the harvest,
if thou husband the field diligently, thou shalt
receive a plentiful harvest.</p>
               <p>Sometime ease and quietness becometh rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and troublesome; therefore ought we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore
to be in action, and exercised in some
good Arts or Studies, as often as we find our
selves ill affected with sloth and idleness which
cannot abide it self. Many are the Instruments
pertaining to Husbandry, I will make choice
of some of the chiefest, and of most frequent
use in Coat-Armour.</p>

               <p>Wheels are the Instruments, whereby Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,
Wagons, and such like things are carried
both speedily and with great facility; and they
are so behoofful for these uses, as that if any
one of them happen to fall off, the whole car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
must either stand still, or at least is forced
forward with great difficulty. As we may see
<hi>Exod.</hi> 14. where God took off the Wheels of
the Chariots of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> that vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prosecuted the <hi>Israelites,</hi> as appeareth <hi>verse
25. And he took off their Chariot Wheels, and
they drave them with much ado; so that the
Egyptians said, I will flie from the face of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
for the Lord fighteth for them against the
Egyptians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Wheel is called in Latin <hi>Rota à rotun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate,</hi>
or else (as some hold) <hi>à ruendo, quia
in declive faciliter ruit,</hi> because it rolleth
down suddenly from the steep declining part of
the ground.</p>
               <p>Other sort of Wheels there are, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
they are not meet for Husbandry, yet I
have held it fit to annex them to these, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of their near resemblance, as in these
Examples may be seen.</p>

call Handycraft or Mechanical Professions; so
called perhaps of <hi>Moecha,</hi> which signifieth an
harlot or an adulterous person; for that as an
harlot counterfeiteth the modest behaviour of
an honest Matron, so do Mechanical Artizans
labour to resemble the Works of Nature, <hi>In
quantum possunt.</hi> These are not performed so
much by wit and invention (like as the Arts
Liberal are) as they be by exercise of the limbs
and labour of the body. And hereof they are
thought to be called Arts, <hi>ab Art<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it is often taken for the limbs themselves
that are so combined and connected toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>How meanly soever we reckon of these in a
relative comparison to the Arts Liberal; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
it is clear, that these (no less than those)
do proceed from the immediate gift of God,

necessary for mans use, and for the support of
humane traffick and society; as we may see
<hi>Eccles.</hi> 38. 31. where after he had made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the care and diligence the Carpenter,

use in their several Professions, he concludeth

and pertaineth to the Sovereign Power

               <p>Nevertheless we read that Monarchical Kings

or Preheminence unto others their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours
upon special acceptable service done, or
for whatsoever private respect, as we may see

had been formerly granted to him by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors
of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> he enableth him to
coin money, saying, <hi>I give thee leave to

               <p>Though the shoe be an habit serving for the
foot, which is the most inferiour part of mans

               </p>
               <p>It was an ancient custome amongst the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
(in transferring of possessions) for him
that departed therewith to pluck off his shoe,
and to deliver the same to his neighbour, as
now it is with us, to pass livery and seis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Inheritance by the delivery of a turf and sprigs
taken off the ground, and delivering the same
to the Purchaser, as appeareth in the Book of
<hi>Ruth;</hi> where it is said, <hi>Now this was the

and changing, for to stablish all things: A
man did pluck off his shoe, and gave it to his
neighbour, and this was a sure witness.</hi> By
which Ceremony he publickly acknowledged
that he had transferred, and put over his
whole right unto the Purchaser, <hi>Ruth.</hi> 4. 7,
8, 9.</p>
               <p>But in after Ages it seemeth the Jews passed
Inheritances by Charters, sealed and testified
by witnesses (a custome of use with us at this
day at the Common Law) as appeareth in the
Prophesie of <hi>Ieremiah; Men shall buy fields
for money, and make writings and seal them,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:55096:118"/>
and take witnesses in the Land of</hi> Benjamin,
<hi>and round about</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 32. 44. And
again, <hi>Ier. 32. 25, And thon hast said unto me,
O Lord God, buy unto thee a field for silver,
and take witnesses. And I bought the field of</hi>
Hananeel <hi>my Uncles son, that was in</hi> Anathoth,
<hi>and weighed him the money, even seventeen
shekels of silver: And I subscribed the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and sealed it, and took witnesses, and
weighed him the money in the balances, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now since I am casually fallen upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of sealing of Deeds, I hold it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
to give some little touch (by the way)
of the first coming in of this custome of seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(in this our Nation) which is now of so
frequent use amongst us.</p>
               <p>First, it is to be observed, that our Ancestors
the Saxons had not the same in use; for they
used only to subscribe their Names, commonly
adding the sign of the Cross. And I need not to
prove the same by the testimony of divers wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses;
for this custome continued here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
until the time that this Realm was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
by <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> who
together with the state of Government (a thing
of common custome with absolute Conquerors)
did alter the before mentioned custome of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
of Deeds, into sealing with wax;
whereupon the <hi>Norman</hi> custome of sealing of
Deeds at length prevailed amongst us. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the before mentioned use of the
<hi>Saxons</hi> therein was utterly abolished; as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth
<hi>Ingulphus</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Crowland,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>The</hi> Normans <hi>do change the making of
writings, which were wont to be firmed in</hi>
England <hi>with crosses of gold and other holy
signs, into printing wax.</hi> And they rejected
also the manner of English writing. This change
was not effected all at once, but took place by
degrees: so that first the King only, and some
few of his Nobility besides, used to seal; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Noblemen for the most part, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>At this time also, as <hi>Ioh. Ross.</hi> noteth, they
used to grave in their seals their own Pictures
and Counterfeits covered with a long Coat over
their Armours.</p>
               <p>After this Gentlemen of the better sort took
up this fashion: and because they were not all
warriors, they made seals ingraven with their
several Coats or Shields of Arms for differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
sake, as the same Author reporteth.</p>
               <p>At length, about the time of King <hi>Edward</hi>
the third, seals became very common; so as not
only those that bear Arms used to seal, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men also fashioned to themselves signets of
their own devising: some taking the letters of
their own names, some flowers, some knots and
flourishes, and other beasts and birds, or some
other things, as now we behold daily in use.</p>

               <p>HAVING exemplified such bearings as

               <p>Pillars, the Hieroglyphicks of Fortitude and

which they could not commodiously do,
if they had been still commorant in solid and
settled buildings. Such is the manner of the

Towns, or Villages to inhabit, but the open

               <p>From King <hi>Solomon</hi>'s House-keeping descend
we now to the Hospitality of the ancient Kings
of this Land. I find in an ancient Manuscript
that King <hi>Lud</hi> commanded his houshold Officers
to have in daily custome, to cover the Tables
in the Hall from seven of the clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till seven in the evening. His daily Diet
was not much in rare and delicate Viands; but
that he kept it constantly with all good Cates
as could be gotten; and at the four great Feasts
he caused Proclamations to be made in all
Countries for all manner of people to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the same Author maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a very memorable and most royal Feast,
that <hi>Cassibelane</hi> made upon his second Triumph
over the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour. And forasmuch as
it is a chief point to be observed of him that
shall cite Authority for any thing that he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
or speaketh of, to use the express words
of his Author which he voucheth, I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
deliver it as he himself relateth the same.</p>
               <p>Domus Regis Cassibelani standeth for a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
note, which after his second triumph up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Emperour, gave out his Royal Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to all the Gentiles in <hi>Britany,</hi> to come
with their Wives to magnifie his Feast: For
which he slew forty thousand Kine and Oxen,
one hundred thousand Sheep, thirthy thousand

               <p>We read of a certain
Church dedicated to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
wherein was a
Lamp that burnt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
and never went
out, but still gave light,
yet was not maintained with any kind of Oyl,
or other fatty matter or substance, and this was
holden for a special miraculous thing; yet might
the same be performed by some other natural
means; as with a certain kind of stone that is
found in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and is called <hi>Asbestus,</hi>
which is said to be of that nature, that being
once kindled and set on fire, doth never extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
or go out, neither is it thereby consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
or wasted, <hi>Zan. lib. 4. de potent, daemon.

               <p>There are doubtless both in herbs and stones
admirable vertues (not manifest) whereby
strange and unwonted effects may be wrought.
Therefore men being ignorant of the efficacy
and forcible vertues of things natural, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
only their effects by sight, do forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
conceive that there is wrought some
strange or great miracle; whereas indeed it is
nothing less but a matter proceeding meerly
from some natural cause.</p>
               <p>Besides these aforesaid, there are sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Instruments of houshold use, as Mortars,
Gridirons, &amp;c. which we leave to observation.
And to this may be referred Candles, Torches,
&amp;c. The great Turk <hi>Solimannus</hi> gave four
Candles for his Device, one burning, the other
three extinct; to signifie that other Religions
were nothing light in respect of his; or that
the other parts of the world should lose their
beauty by the brightness of his glory.</p>

               <p>Endless is the swift passage of time, which
we shall better discern, if we look backwards
to the times that have already over-slipped
us.</p>
               <p>The best means we can devise to bridle time
is to be evermore well exercised in some honest,
vertuous, and laudable work; so shall it not
escape us fruitlesly, according to that saying of

                  <hi>Petrarch, Virtute &amp; industria, bonarumque

sure to carry a hand over time, and not time
over us: so shall we, if not clip his wings that

not unprofitably,</p>
               <p>Time slippeth from us suddenly, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strippeth
us, which only we ought greedily to
seize upon, and in no case barter or exchange
the same for any costly price or reward. Let us
(though late, yet not too late) begin to love
and hold time in estimation, which only a man
may lawfully and honestly covet. Let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
our selves of the shortness of our time,
and our own frailty, and endeavour our selves
to make good use thereof; and let us not then
(as <hi>Seneca</hi> admonisheth us) begin to live, when
life begins to leave us.</p>

He beareth Azure, a
Ruther or Helm of a
Ship, Argent. By the
help of this Helm doth
the Pilot wield the Ship
at will through the most
violent Seas. Some men
are of opinion, that the
first invention of the
Helm of a Ship was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Kite flying, or rather gliding in the
Air, that by turning of his tail one while one
way, another while another way, doth guide
his course in the Air: whereby it seemeth that
Nature would manifest in the clear Air, what
was behoveful to be practised in the deep wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
So necessary is the use of this Instrument,
as that without it no shipping can be directed
in a certain course, but would be evermore in
peril of splitting upon Shoals and Rocks,
through the forcible current and surging waves
of the Sea, and the violence of the boysterous
winds, notwithstanding the might of the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest
Pilots or Mariners, to their great hazard
and astonishment, as we may see <hi>Psalm 107.
25, 26, &amp;c. For at his word the stormy wind
ariseth, which lifteth up the waves thereof.
They are carried up to heaven, and down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to the deep; their soul melteth away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the trouble. They reel to and fro, and
stagger like a drunken man, and are at their
wits ends.</hi> Other parts of Ships have been

tossed with every wave of affection. But
in these tossings of Fortunes waves, wise was
the resolution of Vicount <hi>Hugo de Melan,</hi>

               <p>THE last of the foresaid Arts we reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be Venation, which <hi>Plato</hi> divideth
into three Species, Hunting, Hawking,
and Fishing; all which, because they tend to
the providing of sustenance for man, <hi>Farnesius</hi>
doth therefore account a Species of Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The dangerous chases of the Bear, the
wild Boar, Bull, &amp;c. whether the same be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
on horseback or on foot, hath a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of Military practice; for it maketh a
man provident in assaulting, as also valorous in
sustaining the brunt of the enemy: it maketh
them politick for choice of places of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and enableth them to tolerate hunger,
thirst, labour, storms, tempests, &amp;c. all which
are most requisite for such as do profess a Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
course of life. What valorous Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
those men have proved, that have been
trained up in the Art of Hunting, when they
have come to the administration and managing
of Martial Affairs, the <hi>Persians</hi> can sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
witness unto us, who had no better means
to become expert Souldiers, than their daily
exercise of Hunting: As also the History of
<hi>Mithridates</hi> King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> who was so much
transported with the love of Hunting, as that
(according to <hi>Farnesius</hi>) by the space of seven
years he took not the benefit of any house ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in City or Countrey to lie in; by means
whereof he so enabled and enured his body to
sustain all hardness, that afterwards he became
a scourge and terrour to the <hi>Romans.</hi> And
therefore this noble kind of Venation is privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
from the title of an Illiberal Art, being
a Princely and Generous Exercise: but those
only, who use it for a trade of life, to make gain
thereof, are to be marshalled in the rank of
Mechanicks and Illiberal Artizans.</p>
               <p>As touching the number of Examples of
things pertaining to this noble exercise of Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
proposed for the first Species of Venation,
I purpose to be very brief; not in respect of
their scarcity, but because of the manifold im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
of the Workman for the present,
that he is not able to furnish me with more.
And having ended with them, I will proceed,
according to order, with the other two Species
of Venation, <hi>viz.</hi> Hawking and Fishing.</p>

               <p>ARTS Mechanical of more necessary use
for the nourishing and preserving of
mans body, we have proposed in the
preceding Examples: there yet rest other Arts
of a second rank, which tend rather to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellishing
and beautifying of Natures works
than to the necessary supply of humane uses;
yea some of them such, as are rather baits to
please the senses, than means to further man's
good. Yet because the custome of times, and
opinion of men, and a certain curious and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
skill hath given esteem and name of Art
unto such superfluous curiosities, we will not
utterly pass them by; the rather, because all
of them being used with moderation, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
men, and for good ends, they may
deservedly have both approbation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.
The first of these is the skill of
Cookery, for the exquisite pleasing of the
Palate; unto which kind of men, some have
been so addicted, that it is storied of a certain
Prince, that he proposed a great reward to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man that should invent a new conceited
dish. And the <hi>Sybarites</hi> were famous in this
kind, who bid their guests a year before the
Feast, and so long were catering for dainties.
It is a Proverb amongst the Jews, <hi>Qui multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicat
carnes, multiplicat vermes:</hi> and most
true it is, that he that daily feedeth his body,
is but a Cook to dress meat for worms. Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Carving, and Imbroidering, serve to
please another sense, the sight; and therefore
is a more ingenious delight: and in this kind
some have been so excellent and renowned, as
that they have been numbred amongst men of
admirable wisdome; as <hi>Apelles, Phidias, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycletus,</hi>
and others, whose works have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
immortal reputation, and some of their
Master-pieces have been prised beyond belief.
All these have sundry Instruments, which may
be (and doubtless have been) born in Coat-Armour;
but because they are not usual, I will
referr them to each man's own observation, and
will give instance in the last of this kind of Arts
of Delight, which we call Playing; which
comprehendeth either Theatrical recreation, or
other Games whatsoever.</p>
               <p>And forasmuch as their first institution was
good, and that they are in themselves the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
exercises, either of the body, or of
wit and invention (and if there be in them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
evil, it is not in them <hi>per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se,</hi> but <hi>per acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi>
because they are abused by those that do
practise and exercise them) I have thought
good to annex them unto the same: such are
Table-playing, Chess, Dice, Racket, Balloon,
&amp;c. The things wherewith these Games are
practised, are born in Coat-Armour, as by these
Examples following may appear.</p>

               <p>This is also the Coat-Armour of Sir <hi>Edmund

<hi>Lincoln,</hi> Kt. which honour he received from
his Majesty King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, the Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth

               <p>If a man play at dice, and depart a winner,
let him try his Fortunes again, he shall be sure
to lose. If a man win, his gains is wasted by
giving away here and there to standers by, and
to the Butlers box; but let him lose never so
much, there is none that will afford him one
jot of restitution.</p>
               <p>In this kind of play many men do over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoot
themselves, and commit such errours for
the loss of a little money, as otherwise they
would not for great sums be hired to do.</p>
               <p>In this Game all manner of vices, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
those of covetousness and swearing do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate
and bear chief sway. Neverthele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
many men observing the casual chance of the
Dice, out of a covetous desire of gain, and
not being rightly informed of the use of this
our mortal life, do with vehemency prosecute
their insatiable thirst and desire of gain, as if
that were the only scope whereto they ought
to direct all their actions of this life: whose
folly, or rather extream madness, is lively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the Book of <hi>Wisdome 15. 12. But they
counted our life a pastime, and our time here
a market for gain: For (say they) we must
be getting every way, though it be by evil
means.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, the hazard of Dice-playing
(according to <hi>Petrarch</hi>) is an huge and insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable
Gulf, a dreadful and sudden Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Patrimonies and Inheritances, a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
of wind, a cloud of same, a spurr to wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
and the roadway to desperation: And
howsoever other recreations are sports, yet
this is nothing but meer grief and vexation of
mind.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>To this Chapter may be referred all other
Games; as the Racket, and that of <hi>Iacobus
Medices,</hi> General to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, whose
Device was a Ball with two Balloons, with this
word, <hi>Percussus Elevor, The harder I am
stricken, the higher I mount.</hi> And this may
serve for conclusion of all Arts and Professions
civil, whether liberal or illiberal, necessary or
delightful whatsoever.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII.</head>
               <p>WHAT manifold variety of Coat-Armours
(consisting of things Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial)
is borrowed from the several
Dignities, Arts, and Exercises of men of civil
life and condition, the foregoing Tracts and
Examples have sufficiently declared. There
now remain such Artificials as are in use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men of military profession, with which
we will shut up this whole Section of things Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial.
By things Military I understand all
such as do pertain to the use and exercise of
Martial Discipline and Service; whereof some
do serve for Order, some for Execution of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Of the first kind are those things which
are for direction in Marchings, Encampings,
Arisings, Assaults, Retreats, &amp;c. and such are
the Banner-Royal, the Standard, Guidon, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
Cornet, &amp;c. For albeit it be true, that
<hi>Leges silent inter Arma,</hi> Laws cannot be heard
amongst clashing of Weapons; yet without
certain Laws of Discipline and Order it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for any Martial attempt to be success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
And therefore this is reckoned as <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>'s
highest glory, that being Captain of an
Army consisting of men of so sundry Nations
and Conditions, he notwithstanding kept them
all under quiet Discipline; the want whereof
hath commonly been the cause, when any great
design hath proved unprosperous.</p>
               <p>The valiant <hi>Zisca</hi> being stark blind, yet sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the midst of his Army, whiles they
were in any pitched Field with the Enemies,
gave such directions upon all occasions, as
that his Army was ever Victorious. And <hi>Caesar</hi>
was in this kind so fortunate, that he fought
fifty pitched Fields with honour, wherein he
alone surpassed the valorous <hi>Marcus Marcellus,</hi>
who is said to have been forty times save one
in the Field. And requisite is it in matters of
so high nature, as are decided by wars, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
care both in directing and obeying,
should be observed; because it hath often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
that the neglect or mistaking of some<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>one
small Circumstance hath been the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of whole Armies, and all the States
thereon depending.</p>
               <p>And since we are about to treat of such Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificials
as are in use amongst men of Military
profession, I hold it not impertinent to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
a little of Military Laws, and some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
concerning Battels and Armies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with such Military Laws and Discipline
as were divulged to the Israelites, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the second month of the second year,
after their coming out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The all-powerful and most provident God
and wise disposer of all things, having made
special choice of a people selected out of all
the Nations of the world for his own peculiar
service, and minding to exercise them under
many afflictions, to prove what was in their
hearts (to the end they might have a feeling
sense of his Almighty presence, and ready de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
at all seasons out of all their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
that so he might humble them, and
make them meet for himself) he did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
lead them into the Land of Promise, so
soon as he had brought them out of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
servitude; but led them to and fro in the
Wilderness by the space of forty years, keeping
them in continual exercise, to prove their faith,
and to bring them out of liking with this world,
and to learn them to depend wholly upon his
Divine Providence, and in all their necessities
to rest solely upon him, and to seek their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and relief from him only.</p>
               <p>This most gracious God, having a tender
care of these his people, and foreseeing in his
Divine Providence how needful discipline was
for the ordering and conducting of so huge and
populous a multitude, in a passage so long, and
withal so full of perils; and knowing that all
Civil Discipline consisted in commanding and
obeying, prescribeth to his servant <hi>Moses</hi> a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
form of government, whereby he might
contain them in their several Offices and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, he commanded</hi> Moses <hi>to number the
Israelites, saying,</hi> Take ye the sum of all the
Congregation of the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Num.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And then having given</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
directions for the marshalling and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:55096:126"/>
the whole Army of the Israelites, he saith,</hi>
Numb. 2. 2. Every man of the children of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
shall camp by his Standard, and under the
ensign of their Fathers house: far off about
the Tabernacle of the Congregation shall they
pitch.</p>

               <p>Here have we in this second Chapter of
<hi>Numbers</hi> an uncontrollable warrant pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the mouth of Almighty God for the
use of two sorts of Ensigns, the one general,
being in number four, only ordained for the
leading and direction of the four Regiments
(as I may so call them.) And the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
serving for the demonstration of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
families, and for the distinguishing of the
particular persons of each family, for the more
commodious distributing of them into bands;
a thing most behoveful for the bestowing and
conducting of so huge a multitude, considering
how many thousand of persons were comprised
in and under every of the above-named Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
So as it is most clear, that these are no
less requisite (in their kind) than the former
in theirs, for the more orderly and effectual
managing of this military expedition of so
long a continuance, and withal subjected to
infinite dangers.</p>
               <p>As touching the tokens or sings used in the
general Standards, we have shewed what they
were after the opinion of <hi>Martinus Borhaus</hi>
(who differeth from <hi>Speed:</hi>) his very words you
may read in the first Chapter and first Section
of this Book.</p>
               <p>But since here is mention made of signs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to particular families and persons, it
may perhaps be questioned what these signs
were. Whereto I answer, That they must of
necessity be <hi>signa existentium in rerum natura,</hi>
because there cannot be a representation of
things that are not. If then they consisted of
the similitude of the things in Essence, or being;
no doubt they were such, as not only the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuller
sort, but the vulgar also (through frequent
use and custome) did well know by their daily
fight and use of them: as being the express
pourtraitures either of Celestial Bodies, as of
the Sun, Moon, Stars, &amp;c. or of things Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunar,
as Meteors fiery, Meteors watery, whereof
we have before spoken in their due places: Or
else of Vegetables, as Trees, Shrubs, Plants,
Fruits, Herbs, Flowers, &amp;c. Or else they were
resemblances of sensitive Creatures; as of Man,
Beasts, Fowls, Fishes, Reptiles: Or else of
Instruments, or Tools of familiar use in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Mechanical Trades, pertaining to life
Civil or Rustick. Which in respect of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and ordinary use were best known to men,
and therefore served most fitly for notes or
marks or precise differencing of each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
family and person from other.</p>
               <p>When a King or Prince do enter the field to
give battel to their enemies, it behoveth that
he be strongly fenced of the Army, both before
and behind; and that he have his being near
the great Standard, in the heart of the battel,
for the more safety of his person, and that he
may the better give directions upon all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the whole Army, as the necessity of the
service shall require.</p>
               <p>It is a thing very dangerous for a King,
Prince, or other General, or whatsoever other
their great Commander, to be over-forward or
venturous to encounter his enemy in battel in his
own person: It sufficeth such to command, and
to give direction, and never to hazard their
persons in battel. But if he must needs put
his person upon the jeopardy of the uncertain
and dangerous events of a battel, it behoveth
that he deferr the same to the last conflict; for
that upon the safety of his person dependeth
the hopeful good success of the battel, and the
safety of the whole Army.</p>
               <p>Besides, so long as the chief Commander is
in life and safety, albeit he be foiled and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited;
yet may he repair his Forces, and
subdue him by whom he was foiled: but his
person being either slain or surprized, there is
no hope of recovery.</p>
               <p>Upon the first display of the Banner of a
King or Prince, or of their General or chief
Commander, it behoveth that some discreet
and ancient Counsellor should make known
publickly the cause, why those wars were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken,
to the intent the same may be known
to be grounded upon lawful cause; and that the
King or Prince doth not rashly attempt the
same, but that he doth it in a lawful quarrel, and
upon just cause.</p>
               <p>Which done, then should he command the
chief Herald to unroll and display the said Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and deliver it to him that is appointed to
bear the same (who before he take the same
must receive the order of Knighthood, if he be
not before Knighted) with a strict charge and
command to hold the same fast, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the honour thereof, even with the extream
hazard of his life, and thereupon to advance
the same in the Name of God, the sole Author
and Giver of all Victory.</p>
               <p>Like as the Laws of Civil Magistracy and
Government were ordained by God: so also
were Military Laws and Ordinances grounded
upon his express Commandment, uttered by
the mouth of the Prophets and Priests; as you
may see particularly, for the exhortation of
Priests, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 1, 2. and of other Officers,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 5. and <hi>Iud.</hi> 7. 3. besides Military
Laws for fight, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 21. that the <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Peace</hi> must be offered, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 11, 12.
&amp;c. for <hi>Spoil,</hi> 20. 19. and the division thereof,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:55096:127"/>
1 <hi>Sam. 30. 26, &amp;c. 1 Chron. 26. 27. Iosh. 22.
8. 2 Chron.</hi> 28. 15. for <hi>Victory;</hi> that it is the
duty of Captains and their Armies (after vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
obtained) to ascribe the whole glory
thereof to God, and with one heart and one
voice to magnifie his most glorious Majesty by
the example of <hi>Iudas Maccabeus, Thus they
went home and sung Psalms, and praised the
Lord in heaven, for he is gracious, and his
mercy endureth for ever, 1 Maccab.</hi> 4. 24.</p>
               <p>The skilful managing of Military Affairs is a
kind of Art; neither doth the publick profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the name of a Souldier, nor yet his lofty
countenance or change of habit forthwith make
a man a Souldier, it is a matter of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
and of no less secrecy; for a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is to be confident in that he undertaketh, and
to wage battel with an assured hope of Victory,
and to retire himself and his Forces (if the
necessity of the cause so require) without fear
of reproach or danger. For as the common
Proverb saith, <hi>A more valorous man is he that
wisely flieth, than he that foolishly exposeth
himself to adventure and hazard; Periti e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,
quam pugnandi:</hi> for it is a matter of no
great difficulty to draw men on to fight; but if
the Captain in his providence, whilst they be
in action, shall discover some unexpected dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
or damage that may befall him and
his Band, and can wisely retire himself with
honour and with safety of his Souldiers, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
himself both valorous in his encounter, and
wise in his retreat.</p>
               <p>The greatest Victories have not been gotten
by handy-strokes always; but many times for
safeguard of the effusion of blood, either the
one part, or the other, devised some witty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
sudden policy or stratagem, to astonish
the adverse part, that so they might suddenly
slaughter them, or put them to shameful
flight. Large is the field of stratagems which
every Commander hath by particular inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
neither hath there been more Victories or
Trophies gained by any one means than by
these Stratagems. Whatsoever cometh beyond
expectation maketh a disturbance or amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Enemy: but it must be wrought
with this caution, that it be no disturbance to
our selves.</p>
               <p>Neither is every slight invention fit to be put
in practice, but such only as have foresight and
circumspection annexed to them. He must be
<hi>Argus</hi> that is a General or chief Commander;
he must be eyed behind, before, in his head,
in his feet; and then shall all things be easily
disposed according to order, and take good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
when orderly distribution, and providence,
and premeditation, have made way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>It is not the length of a man's age, or the
number of years, that yieldeth the art or skill
of managing Military Affairs; but a continual
meditation how he may encounter all occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and put them in exercise and practice:
For if a man receive never so many stipends,
yet is the unexercised man still but a freshwater
Souldier notwithstanding.</p>
               <p>There were in former Ages two sorts of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
or discharge from Military Service; the
one named <hi>ignominiosa,</hi> that is to say, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious
or infamous: as when a Souldier for
some notorious crime was discharged from his
service, and disgracefully put out of pay and
place, as for slothfulness, cowardize, forsaking
of his Captain, or such like; then he was by
the Tribune dismissed of his place, and brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the mark of infamy and reproach, if
he were so by the Tribune discharged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of his Military Ornaments.</p>
               <p>The other was called <hi>Causaria missio,</hi> as much
to say as an occasional dismission or discharge,
grounded upon good and lawful considerations:
as when in regard of debility, by reason of
age or sickness, wounds or other infirmities pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
a man, he was licenced to depart to his
home; and those that were thus dismissed, did
most commonly dedicate their Shields, Swords,
and Armour, <hi>Laribus suis,</hi> to their Houshold
Gods, as the Heathen termed them, by hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them up upon the walls in some chief or
special place or room of their House, for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
of their service performed in defence of
their Friends and Countrey.</p>
               <p>Martial men are evermore in peril and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of life, in regard of their light esteem of
the manifold varieties, casualties, and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
events of wars, whereunto they do ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
expose themselves: for Fortune thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
not her perils more abundantly upon any
sort of men, than upon those that set her at
naught; such are high spirited and valorous
men. And not without cause; for as others
do labour to shelter themselves from danger,
and do shun the violence thereof; these contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise
do lay open themselves to the utmost
hazard that may befall them.</p>
               <p>Call to mind the fore-passed Ages, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them to the point, and you shall find that
the valiantest men (for the most part) have
been swallowed up with a violent death. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
doth oftentimes make men to swell with
pride, and to insult over others, and provoke
them to their own destruction, as we may see
2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14. 8. where <hi>Amaziah</hi> summoned the
son of <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> King of <hi>Israel</hi> to single com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
saying, <hi>Come let us look one another in
the face.</hi> Who answered him, <hi>Because thou
hast smitten</hi> Edom, <hi>and thine heart hath lifted
thee up; glory of this and tarry at home: for
why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou
shouldest fall, even thou and</hi> Judah <hi>with
thee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some men are of opinion, that such as are
vanquished in battel ought not to be captivated
to such as had subdued them, unless the wars
were just and lawful, as Dr. <hi>Casius</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
But <hi>Borreus</hi> holdeh, that albeit the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:55096:128"/>
ground or cause of the wars that are underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
be unjust; yet it is not simply unjust that
such as are vanquished in battel, should be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
under the power of the Vanquisher; <hi>Quia
Legislatoris intentio est, ut virtus vincentis sic
honoretur;</hi> the purpose of the Law-maker was
that the valour of the Vanquisher should be so
rewarded. Besides, it is no ignominious thing
for a man to be subdued by a man accounted of
valour, according to that saying, <hi>Non tam
turpe est vinci, quam contendisse gloriosum;</hi>
It is not reckoned a matter so reproachful to
be subdued, as it is honourable to have coped
with a magnanimous and valiant man.</p>
               <p>Many men are remunerated for the vertues
that are found in them, or for the external to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of vertue that are observed in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
carriage. Hereupon is that Law ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Quod capti bello victoribus subserviant;</hi> not
for that the Conquerours are always the better
men, but in regard that in them the signs and
tokens of vertue and valour are more apparent
than in those that are subdued.</p>
               <p>It is a just dominion or superiority, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the order of Nature, that the more
powerful should predominate over the weaker
fort. And the Laws do seem to approve the
same, <hi>Cum velint victum captum in bello vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoris
servum fieri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a Law of perpetuity (<hi>saith</hi> Zenophon)
observed amongst men, that when a Town or
City that held out the Assailants is surprised,
whatsoever is found therein is due to them that
took the same, as well the persons as their
whole substance; <hi>whose opinion herein</hi> Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle
<hi>followeth,</hi> Polit. 40. <hi>And St.</hi> Ambrose
lib. 1. de Patriarch. <hi>writeth,</hi> That the prey of
the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> was in like sort in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>Abraham</hi> that conquered him.</p>
               <p>This custome hath been also observed, That
to ask leave to bury the slain in the time of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
hostility, and whilst men are in Arms in
the Field, or depart the Field after Battel, is
a kind of yielding of victory: for it beseemeth
not them that won the Battel to seek any thing
of the enemy by way of intreaty. Like as
also the unwillingness to joyn Battel, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
or delay of Battel was taken for a
yielding of Victory.</p>
               <p>And now we will begin with Examples of
bearing such things in Coat-Armour, whereby
Martial Discipline and Order, which we have
now discoursed of, are preserved; whereof
some are for shew, other for sound.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Very behoveful are these Ensigns for every
particular Band of Foot and Troop of Horse,
to the end they may know whither to draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in expectance of the command of their
Captain for the performance of all occasions;
and that they may by them be directed after
any conflict or skirmish, whither to retire
themselves without danger: they also serve for
the manifest distinguishing of Bands and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies.
And by these they are all directed in
their Services, as a Ship is guided through the
forcible and violent surges of the Seas, by the
benefit of her Helm and a skilful Pilot guiding
the same.</p>
               <p>The Ensigns that the <hi>Romans</hi> anciently used<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
were of divers shapes: the Eagle fixed on the
top of a Pike or Pole was the chief; but that
they had Penons or Flags also, appeareth by
<hi>Lazius,</hi> who saith they were called <hi>vexilla,
à velis navium,</hi> from the Sails of Ships, which
they resembled, being so named <hi>tanquam mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
velum,</hi> as it were a little Sail.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>These foresaid Instruments serve for directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on and order to the eye, and by shew. To these
Ensigns thus born in the Field in time of Battel
either expected or acted, we may add this
known Ensign of premonstration of eminent
hostile invasion, which is the fired Becacon,
which giveth a sudden warning of instant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
attempt or invasion of Enemies, the
notice whereof giveth occasion of the firing of
the Beacon: whereupon a Gentleman of good
reputation chose to bear for his Impress, upon
a Mount a Beacon fired, with this Motto annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Sic periisse juvat;</hi> meaning to die for his
Countries safety was his desire. The bearing
in Arms of three of these fired Beacons appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

               <p>There is manifold uses of the Drum, Fife,
Trumpet, and other Musical Instruments used
in Martial Affairs, inasmuch as they serve not
only for the direction of Companies &amp; Troops,
but also of the whole Army in their Marchings,
Encampings, Risings, Assaults, Retreats, &amp;c.
but also to dead and drown the cries of the
maimed and wounded, and to stir up valour and
courage in the Souldiers to the fierce encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
and assaulting of the Enemy: and for
these ends was the use of them ordained in
wars, to which purpose do these Instruments
much avil, <hi>Sonus enim cornuum &amp; tubarum
(in praeliis) magnum vim habet ad spiritus,
&amp; sanguinem evocandum.</hi> For it is not with
men as it is with beasts, which can stir up cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
in themselves, as I have before shewed:
For men in respect of fear and faint courage,
are hardly provoked to fight, therefore had
they need to be drawn on and provoked there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>

               <p>These Clarions are sometimes described
Rests: but whether they be understood to be
the Rudder, or from the Name to be a thing
whereon to rest their Launces, I know not; but
am rather induced to believe them to be Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
used in Battel and Tournaments, as we
do Trumpets: For I find <hi>Robert Consul</hi>'s Coat,
base Son to <hi>Henry</hi> the first, blazoned Clarions
of these very colours: And in many old De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
of Tilting, we find the Knights to
come in with Clarions sounding before them.</p>

               <p>THE next are such things as serve for
execution of order, which is the final
end for which Military Profession is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,
<hi>viz.</hi> propulsation, or revenge of
wrong, or for foiling the wrong-doer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
to give satisfaction to the party grieved.
And as in the Law Politick, so in this Law Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary,
Execution is reckoned the soul thereof.
To the accomplishment of execution of order,
sundry sorts of weapons are requisite: some
invasive or offensive, others defensive; the one
to protect our selves, the other to impeach our
foes. And of these invasives will we speak in
the first place; beginning with those which we
call <hi>Missilia,</hi> such as are cast or forced by
strength of hand, or slight of Engine: and after
we will come to such as are manual, or managed
with the hand.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>There are divers sorts of these kind of Guns,

This battering Ram was a warlike Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
much used by the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
any City or Hold with purpose to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
them. Such an Engine (amongst divers
others) did <hi>Titus Vespatianus</hi> erect against the
City of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which were by <hi>Iosephus</hi>
and his Associates consumed with fire. Such
is the force of this Engine, as that there is no
Tower so strong, or Circuit of a Citie so spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
but if that they resist the first brunt
thereof, through often use they will be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>

               <p>The Arrow is called in Latin <hi>Sagitta</hi> (as
some do conceit it) <hi>quasi satis ictus,</hi> for that
it annoyeth and galleth the Enemy farr enough
off, so as he cannot approach the Archer to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammage
him, because by the smart delivery
of the Bow the Enemy is put to hazard a
great way off: others would have it called (and
not unaptly) <hi>quod sagax sit ictus ejus,</hi> for that
the same being directed by the hand of a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and skilful Archer doth cleave the pinn or
mark oftentimes in two, though the same be
but of a small scantling.</p>
               <figure/>

keep or annoy him afar off. This is called in
Latin <hi>Iaculum, quia è longinquo jaciatur;</hi> it

Feasts, amongst other Exercises used the
game of Sword-playing, to the end that in time
of Peace they being accustomed to behold
Fighting, Wounds, and Swords, might be the
less discouraged, when they see the feats of
Arms in the Field against the Enemy; and
therefore the Chiestain or General of the Hoste
was to exhibit to the people a game of Fence or
Sword-playing.</p>

               <p>Before a man shall go about to buckle with
his enemies, it behoveth that the Army be
fully furnished, and provided with all sorts of
Military Provisions both defensive and offensive,
by the example of <hi>Vzziah</hi> King of <hi>Iudah;</hi> of
whom it is said,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uzziah</hi> had also an hoste of fighting men that
went out to warr by bands according to the
count of their number under the hand of <hi>Jeiel,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Uzziah</hi> prepared them throughout all
the hoste shields, and spears, and helmets, and
brigandines, and bows, and stones to sling, 2
Chron. 26. 11, 14.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>As concerning the quantity or weight of
Spears heads, we find them in all Ages answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the strength of the persons that were
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:55096:132"/>
to manage them: So we read that the Spear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
of <hi>Golias,</hi> that encountred with <hi>David,</hi>
weighed six hundred shekels of Iron, which was
correspondent to his Spear, that was resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for bigness to a Weaver's beam; as also
to the hugeness of his stature, which was six
<hi>Cubits and a hands breadth, 1 Sam,</hi> 17. 4. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
we read of <hi>Ishhibenob</hi> the son of <hi>Haraphah</hi>
(of the race of the Giants) <hi>whose head of his
spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass,
even he being girded with a new sword
thought to have slain</hi> David.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>Now I shall, I hope, without any great
breach of Method, demonstrate the bearing
in Armory of some part of a Tilt-spear or
Tilt-stave, call it which you please: which
kind of weapon or instrument, although it be
not of any use in the wars; yet the well man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging
thereof maketh a man the more expert
for Military Service on Horsback, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may challenge to be ranked among Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial

               <figure/>
               <p>Touching the variety of Shields or defensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
weapons and their uses, we read that the
<hi>Roman</hi> Captains or Leaders had their light
harnessed Souldiers on foot, armed only with
Sword and Target, and were called <hi>Rorarij;</hi>
whose Office was with a light skirmish to give
the first onset on the enemy, to see if they
could force them to remove their first station,
and so make way for the Horsmen, <hi>sicut Ros
ante gelu, as the dew or moist goeth before
the frost, Alex. gen. dierum. lib. 6. pag.</hi> 369.</p>
               <p>This sort of Souldiers were highly rewarded
of Kings, in regard of their bold adventure in
bearing the first brunt of the battel. Of these
some were called <hi>Peltati,</hi> because they were
armed with a kind of Shield or Target like to
a Half-moon; some <hi>Cetrati,</hi> for that they were
armed with light Targets or Bucklers after the
<hi>Spanish</hi> or <hi>Africk</hi> fashion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us Marius</hi> did prohibit his Souldiers the
bearing of sleight and small Targets, in regard
of their unserviceable use.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Romulus</hi> had made a League with
<hi>Tatius</hi> King of the <hi>Sabines,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aside the <hi>Graecian</hi> Shield (which formerly
they used) assumed the <hi>Sabine</hi> Shield; and
<hi>Romulus</hi> did interchange Armours with the
<hi>Sabines,</hi> and continued the use of them It is
a thing that hath been of some men holden for
an infallible observation, that all Nations do
change (if not the form of Martial Discipline)
their Military weapons at the least, once in the
space of an hundred years upon some one occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
or other.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Germans</hi> it was holden a thing
so ignominious for a man to lose his Shield
in fight, as nothing could be more reproachful;
insomuch as he that was found culpable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
was excluded from all Sacred Rites and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Councils; yea, so odious was it holden
amongst them, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>at many (having escaped
the battel) were branded with this publick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy,
and being unable to sustain so great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
have hanged themselves.</p>
               <p>Amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> it was in use oftentimes
to lay their Children new born in Shields in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of Cradles; because they held it a presage
of future fortitude and valour in the Child.
So we read that <hi>Hercules,</hi> who exceeded all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of that Age in Fortitude, was rocked in a
Shield.</p>
               <p>A certain <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> skirmishing with
his Enemy, and having his Sword drawn,
and spying some advantage thereto, was
minded to have run him through therewith
instantly: the sign of retreat was given, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he forbare; and being demanded why he
slew not his Enemy when it was in his power;
he answered, <hi>Melius est parere Imperatori,
quam hostem occidere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, as touching the Shield, we read
that it was usual to hang them up in Churches
instead of Epitaphs, as is the use here amongst
us at this day, though not to that end, as is
gathered by the words of <hi>Trebellius Pollio</hi> in
the History of <hi>Chaudius Caesar,</hi> where he saith,
<hi>Claudium Principem l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Like as the Shield served in the battel for a
defence and safeguard of the body of Souldiers
against blows and wounds: even so in time of
peace, the same being hanged up, it did shield
and defend the owner against the malevolent
detractions of the envious sort, who do labour
to deprave mens best actions, they themselves
never endeavouring any that were laudable;
whereby they do verifie in themselves that

corrode them with their venomous teeth of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction

shields which we call Arms suspense, do (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al)
not only possess, but also beautifie the
room with a Military Ornament; wherein each
mans particular Arms are expressed at this day,
and the Helmets and Crests, consisting of

upon them, are placed above the shields; <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius

               <p>Concerning the defensive furniture of mans
body we read, that anciently they were made
of linen cloth, of exceeding high proof.
Such was that much famoused linen Brigandine
of <hi>Amasis</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whereof every thread
consisted of 360 other threads, wherein were
pourtraied and set forth the forms and shapes
of manifold sorts of Animals (that he used to
prosecute in his accustomed exercise of Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
in gold and divers coloured yarn. And
not only the furniture ordained for the safety
of mans body were made of linen in those
days; but also the furniture of the Horses (of
such as were called <hi>Cataphracti Equites</hi>) as
their Bardings and Caparisons, were also made
of linen artificially wrought with barrs of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
after the manner of feathers, and both of
them so curiously intermix'd and platted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as that (in fine) it becometh a defence of
impenetrable resistance against any sort of
weapons: which kind of furniture was in use
with the <hi>Romans,</hi> not only for the safeguard
of the Horses, but also for the safety and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the <hi>Cataphracti,</hi> or such as we
term men of Arms compleatly furnished Cap-a-pe
(as the French pharse is) to withstand and
sustain the shock or brunt of the Enemy,
by whom also the discomfited forces have been
often repaired.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Of the first sort are the Shafron, the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
and the Bard, whereof I find no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Examples of bearing single and apart, but
as they are born conjunct in the total furniture
of Horses for the Field, as shall hereafter in
their due place be shewed. I will here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
set forth such as are of ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
use, as they are severally born in Escoche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as followeth.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>To these may be added whatsoever other
parts of the furniture of Horses fitting for the
wars; as Snaffles, Bitts, Bridles, and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like tokens, whereby is signified restraint
of liberty, or servile subjection, as appeareth
where it is said, <hi>After this now</hi> David <hi>smote
the Philistims and subdued them, and he
took the Bridle of Bondage out of the hands of
the Philistims.</hi>
               </p>
               <figure/>
               <p>A Horse thus furnished is fitted and prepared
for the use of a Souldier of that sort which we
call <hi>Cataphracti Milites,</hi> or men at Arms, of
whom I shall make mention in the next Esco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon.
Not much unlike this is the Caparison
wherewith we use to set out our Horses prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the Tilt, in our joyful Triumphs of
Peace. I read that it was a custome amongst
the <hi>Romans</hi> (as well in their lesser as greater
Triumphs) that no man (but such as by Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
either in respect of some honourable or
eminent place, or special merit, were thereto
priviledged) might meet or accompany him
that triumphed on horsback, but altogether on
foot, which custome was of long time observed
amongst them.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>These were those Souldiers strongly armed
in steel, called <hi>Cataphracti Equites,</hi> which I
lately spoke of: they were habited with Haber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
which were either Coats of Mail or of
Plate; and differed much from those that we
call <hi>Levis Armaturae Milites,</hi> in respect of
the ponderous we ght of their furniture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
both themselves and their Horses were the
better inabled to receive the shock and strong
encounter of their enemy. Whose Armour
were a Sallad or a Head-piece, their Shield,
Graves and Brigantines, all of Brass, their
Bassenets or Sculls, Spears and Swords, like
those in use with Foot-men. Such was the
force of these <hi>Cataphracti Milites</hi> (or as we
call them, men mounted upon barded Horses)
as that they were able to endure the brunt of
the Enemies, and did oftentimes repair the
Forces of the trembling and distrustful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>

               <p>HAVING in the two former Chapters
handled Artificials Military, both inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
and defensive, I think it not much
amiss now a little to treat of Trophies &amp; tokens
of Martial Victory, and to shew you some Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems
of Rewards for Victory obtained, born
in Coat-Armour, since Victory and the hope
thereof sweetneth all those dangerous Travels
and intolerable Labours, which the brave Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
man joyfully runeth through, yea even to
the hazard of his life. <hi>Trophies</hi> (saith <hi>Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us)
are spoils forced from the conquered Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
all embrued with blood, and hanged up
as they were upon the next Tree that could be
found to fit that purpose; or else the conquering
Souldiers brought them home to their Houses,
where they hanged them up upon some Pole or
Tree called</hi> Gentilitia arbor, <hi>for a monument of
the encrease of Glory that they had atchieved
to the Family by their valour. The like cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>
(saith <hi>Wolf. Laz.) do we not only read
of in</hi> Thucydides; <hi>but my self have seen and
observed represented in ancient Coins, an Oak
having the limbs cut off, and upon the snaggs
thereof were hanged a German Cloak made of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:55096:136"/>
Badgers skins (or such other like) called</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerna
Germanica; <hi>two Shields, a Barbaria
Pipe, and a German Ensign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was also another sort of Trophie,
when a man had subdued his Enemies, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
was to express the memory of the victory
atchieved (as it was acted) in Letters engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and cut in stone, together with the names
of the People and Kings that were vanquished;
and this was usually set up in some publick
place for the perpetuating of the memory of
such their famous conquest to all Posterities.
To this purpose is that which <hi>Cicero</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>ad Heren. Hic in Macedonia Trophaea po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit,
eaque quae bellicae laudis victoriaeque om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes

And so is that place of <hi>Pliny, lib. 37. cap.</hi> 2.
where he writeth that <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The ancient Rewards for victory obtained in
the field, born in Arms are Garlands, which
the Armorists call Chaplets, and in Latin they
were anciently called <hi>Coronae militum:</hi> and of
these there then were divers sorts, which were
conferred on the Victors, and were significant
demonstrations of the manner of the victory
obtained; for the ancient Bearers, Horsmen,
Captains and Lieutenants of Cities, Towns,
and Ports, which had valorously sustained and
indured the siege of their Enemies, and were
delivered from them, were guerdoned in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
times with a Garland of Grass, called in
Latin <hi>Corona Graminea sive obsidionaria;</hi>
which although it were made of Grass (being
the only herb that can be supposed to be found
in a place long besieged) yet is the same Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
Gramine (as <hi>Pliny</hi> witnesseth) most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and noble, and to be esteemed above
all others; Gold, Pearl, Olive, Laurel, Palm,
Oak and Ivy, giving place to common Grass,
that Royal Herb of Dignity.</p>
               <p>He also that could prudently delay his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and preserve the Army committed to his
charge from loss, without giving battel, was
wont to be rewarded with this kind of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
Garland: such an one was <hi>Fabius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
Qui corona Graminea donatus fuit ab u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversa
Italia; quandoquidem non pugnando
sed cavendo rem Romanam restituisset, &amp; exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citum
sibi creditum conservasset.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was another sort of Chaplet called <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona
Civica,</hi> which among the <hi>Romans</hi> was in
esteem next to the <hi>Corona Graminea.</hi> And it
was made of Oaken leaves and branches, with
the fruit of Acorns hanging on it. This Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
or Chaplet was given to him that had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a Citizen when his life was in extream pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill,
killing his enemy, and making good the
place where the danger happened. And <hi>Pliny</hi>
maketh mention, that this sort of Chaplet was
to be given to one who slew the first Enemy,
that mounted on the walls of a City or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress,
being defended by, or for the <hi>Romans.</hi>
And I read, that <hi>Hostius,</hi> the Grandfather of
the Roman King <hi>Hostilius,</hi> for his prowess was
the first that was remunerated by <hi>Romulus</hi>
with a Chaplet called <hi>Corona Frondea,</hi> and
this was <hi>quod Fidenam irrupisset;</hi> it was <hi>Anno
Mundi</hi> 3295.</p>
               <p>The triumphal Chaplet was first made of
Laurel, and such an one did <hi>Tiberius Caesar</hi>
use. The <hi>Athenian</hi> Victors had their Chaplets
or Garlands of Olive-leaves; and these Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
were rewards also as well for Mercurial as
Martial Deeds, some of which at first made of
leaves, were afterward altered and composed
of Cold. <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth that the Rose, the
Lily, and the Violets, be the flowers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Chaplets or Garlands of Noblemen
ought to be adorned. I confess he there useth
the Latin word <hi>Corona;</hi> but I think, under
favour, there that word <hi>Corona</hi> cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for a Crown, I mean such an one as is in
use with us at this day made of Gold, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for a Chaplet or Garland.</p>
               <p>I find also that Chaplets are sometimes made
of other Herbs, as of Rue; as that which is
born bend-wife upon the barrs of the Coat-Armour
of the Dukedom of <hi>Saxony;</hi> which,
as learned Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> out of <hi>Kran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and brother to <hi>Otho</hi> the then Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess,

Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> granted to the said <hi>Bernard</hi>

               <p>SINCE there be some things born in
Arms, which have a near resemblance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves, yet do really differ
each from other in name, of which we have
not hitherto given any Rule: I hope, with the
Readers courteous leave, I may gather such
here together, which otherwise, according to
strict Method, should have been ranked farr
asunder; by which means the Student in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
(for whose benefit only this work is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled)
may with more facility observe the nice
differences of such Charges, which are differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced,
and consequently change their names,
only from their</p>
               <p>Distinction of their
Colours or Forms.</p>
               <p>Of the first sort are Roundles, of which
<hi>Leigh</hi> giveth Examples of nine sundry, each
differing from other in name and blazon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their different Colours; as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>

               <p>Of some of these, <hi>viz.</hi> Bezants, Plates,
Hurts, and Pellets, I have given Examples for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
in this Book. Examples of Bezants and

               <p>It is not requisite in blazon to name the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of any of these nine Rundles, except they
be the counterchanged Charge of a Field trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted,
as in <hi>Abt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

find the blazon in the fifth Section and second
Chapter; and in such a case they are called
Rundles, and by no other name. But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it is sufficient to say, he beareth Argent, on
a Chief, Gules, three Bezants, as I have done
in the blazon of <hi>Russel</hi>'s Coat-Armour, <hi>p.</hi> 219.
without telling of the colour of the Bezants.
The like you may observe in Captain <hi>Lee</hi>'s
Arms, <hi>pag.</hi> 245. which I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ave blazoned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
telling the colour of the Pellets. As for
the word <hi>Proper</hi> used in the blazon of the
Hurts, <hi>pag.</hi> 103. and of the Pellets in <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s
Coat, <hi>pag.</hi> 245. they are faults I must
confess escaped in the correcting of this Edition;
therefore I do intreat the Courteous Reader
with his Pen in those two places to put out the
word <hi>Proper:</hi> yet I cannot deny but that in
ancient blazon I have seen the Colours of some
of these Rundles named; yea, and some are
of opinion that one or two sorts of these differ
their names in the quantity of their figure, and
not in colour; but of latter times, amongst our
English blazoners, it is accounted a great fault
to tell their colours, except where they are
found counterchanged in a Field transmuted, as
I have formerly said.</p>

               <p>Anciently Blazoners did use to tell the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the position of a Charge, consisting of
three things of one sort or kind placed in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle,
as you see these here are, by saying,
three Torteauxes, Plates, Mullets, Crescents,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:55096:138"/>
or the like, in triangle, or two and one; but
it is now observed as a general Rule, That when
the number three is rehearsed in Arms, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
further declaration of the location or posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the charge demonstrated by that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
then are they always placed in the fashion
that is shewed in this present Escocheon; but
if they have their location in any other form,
then you must always tell how and in what
manner, as in this next Escocheon.</p>

               <p>And thus much may suffice to have spoken
of such Charges as are differenced only from
their distinction of their Colours, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
change their Names; all which you
may observe to be composed of a Circula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.
Now it remaineth that I treat of those
other which have a nearer resemblance among
themselves, yet vary their names only from
their distinction of form.</p>
               <p>Of this sort are <list>
                     <item>Fusils,</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The Geometrician calleth the kind of Figure
whereof every of these is composed <hi>Rhombus,</hi>
which <hi>Keckerman</hi> saith, is <hi>Parallelogram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
obliquangulum &amp; equilaterum;</hi> for in
truth every one of these consist of four Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritical
lines of equal length, yet these are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
named by Armorists, as I shall presently
shew you. But I think it first necessary to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
unto you the Figure of every of these, as
in Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>A Lozenge differeth from a Fusil, in that the
space between its two collateral or middle An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
equals the length of any of the four Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical
Lines whereof it is composed, as its
Figure before more plainly manifesteth; where
the space between the Angles demonstrated by
the figures 3 and 3, and 1 and 3, are of equal
length. I confess sometimes you may find in
things made for Lozenges, the distance here
demonstrated by the figures 3 and 3 to be a
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:55096:138"/>
little longer than that from 1 to 3, but it can
never be shorter, for then it is a Fusil.</p>
               <p>A Mascle differeth from both the Fusil and
Lozenge; first, because the Mascle is always
voided, that is, part of the Field is transparent
through it. I confess in this I dissent from
<hi>Leigh</hi>'s opinion, who in his <hi>Accidence of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
pag. 157. b.</hi> seemeth to grant that a
Mascle may be whole: but of this I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
shewed my opinion and my reason for
the same, <hi>pag.</hi> 234. Next, a Mascle differeth
from a Fusil and a Lozenge in the proportion of
space, which is evidently demonstrated in the
Mascles Figure by the Letters <hi>C</hi> and <hi>D,</hi> which
sheweth a Mascle to be as long as it is broad.</p>
               <p>Now proceed we to give you some Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of bearing these Fusils and Lozenges in
Coat-Armour; as for Mascles, I have already
shewed some, <hi>pag.</hi> 234.</p>

To these Charges that thus resemble each
other, yet change their Names from their nice
differing forms, may be referred the Quarter
and the Canton, the Delf and the Billet, and
such other like. Examples of the bearing of
every of which I have formerly given, leaving
the Student in this way to learn their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
by his careful observation, to which

great light.</p>
               <p>Thus have I in this one Section run over

               <p>HAVING finished the former
Section, treating of Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
formed of things Artificial,
in which there is tincture (that
is to say, Metal, Colour of Furr)
predominating: I will now (<hi>secundis velis</hi>) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to give Examples of Coat-Armours ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no Tincture predominating in them. These
are formed of sundry sorts of lines of Partition,
occasioning oftentimes Transmutation and
Counterchanging.</p>
               <p>Coat-Armours having no Tincture predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
in them, are such as are so composed
and commix'd of two colours, as that neither
of them do surmount other. Such are these
that follow, and the like, which are formed of
lines of Partition only.</p>
               <p>In giving Examples of these forms of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it is requisite that I begin with those which
consist of single lines of Partition; and then
proceed to such sorts as are formed of manifold
lines, as in Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Such Coat-Armours
as are formed only of
lines of Partition, do
(generally) yield testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of an ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
as <hi>Hieronymus Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi>
in his <hi>Genealogies</hi>
noteth (upon the Coat-Armour of the Noble
Race of the <hi>Ranzovij,</hi> which is born parted
after this manner, though of different colours)
in this Distichon:
<q>
                     <l>Forma quid haec simplex? simplex fuit ipsa ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tustas:</l>
                     <l>Simplicitas formae stemmata prisca not at.</l>
                     <l>What means so plain a Coat? times ancient plain

After this manner may two Coat-Armours
of distinct Families be conjoyned into one Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocheon,

                  <hi>Leigh</hi> holdeth that
this sort of bearing is

(some Blazoners are of opinion that) when
this composition consisteth meerly of Metals

Furrs and Colour, without any charge occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the quarters of the Escocheon, such bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is more aptly blazoned parted <hi>per</hi> Cross,

               <p>Two other sorts of parted <hi>per</hi> Pile I find,

               <p>As these last mentioned Coats are framed of
straight lines of Partition, so shall you find others
composed of sundry lines before spoken of, in

lines, as of those that are bunched. And as
these last handled do utterly exclude all mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Tinctures whereof they are form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by reason of the straightness of the lines
wherewith they be divided: so contrariwise

in Field and Charge, occasioned by the apposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some one or more lines of Partition.
Such Coat-Armours may be fitly resembled to
the party-coloured-garements, so much esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in ancient time, as they were held meet for
the Daughters of Kings during the time of
their virginity. So we read of <hi>Thamar</hi> the

               <head>SECT. VI. CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>FROM our first ingress in this Book,
hitherto hath been handled at large
the first part of the Division of this
whole Work, under the general
Head of Blazoning; wherein have
been confined and illustrated Examples of the
divers and variable kinds of bearing of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Coat-Armours, of whatsoever substance,
form, or quality consisting, together with the
general and particular Rules in their proper
places, for the better instruction of the regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Reader. It now succeedeth in order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that other general Head (being the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
part of the first Division) termed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalling.
Which term I am not ignorant of
how farr extent it is, not only in ordering the
parts of an Armie, but also for disposing of all
persons and things in all Solemnities and Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations,
as Coronations, Interviews, Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Funerals, Triumphs, and the like, in which
the Office of an Herald is of principal use for
direction of others; and therefore his Learning,
Judgment, and Experience ought to be able to
direct himself in so weighty Affairs. But that
noble part of Marshalling is so absolutely alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
performed by the industrious Pen of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
Sir <hi>William Segar</hi> Kt. late <hi>Garter</hi> and
Principal King at Arms, in his Book of <hi>Honour
Military and Civil,</hi> as that it were but Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy
joyn'd with Ignorance for me to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle
in an Argument so exactly handled:
Neither is here my purpose other, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
my self to Armory only, and so far only to
speak of Marshalling, as it concerns Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.
This Marshalling therefore is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
disposing of sundry Coat-Armours per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to distinct Families, and of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent
Ornaments, with their Parts and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances
in their proper places. Of these
things, some have their place within the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scocheon,
some without: and of those within
the Escocheon, some have their occasions ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
other some manifest; as are those whose
Marshalling (according to ancient and prescript
forms) do apparently either betoken Marriage,
or some gift of the Sovereign. Such as beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:55096:150"/>
Marriage do represent either a Match sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
or hereditary: By a single Match I mean
the conjoyning of the Coat-Armours of a man
and a woman, descended of distinct Families,
in one Escocheon Pale-ways, as by Examples
following shall appear. And this form of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paling
is divers according to the several Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of persons, whether Ecclesiastical or
Temporal. Such as have a Function Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical,
and are preferred to the high honour
of Pastoral Jurisdiction, are reckoned to be
knit in Nuptial bands of love and tender care to
the Cathedral Churches whereof they are Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents,
insomuch as when a Bishop de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaseth,
<hi>Ejus Ecclesia dicitur viduata.</hi> And
therefore their Paternal Coat is evermore mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalled
on the left side of the Escocheon, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the preheminence of the right side to the
Arms of their See, <hi>obreverentiam dignitatis
Ecclesiasticae,</hi> for the honour due to Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Dignity; as also in respect that the Arms
of such several Sees have in them a kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity,
for that they belong to a Political Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which never dieth. An Example of such
Impaling is this which followeth, and this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Bearing we may aptly call <hi>Baron</hi> and
<hi>Femme.</hi>
               </p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The most Reverend Father in God, Dr.
<hi>William Lawde,</hi> late Lord Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>
his Grace, Primate of all <hi>England</hi> and
Metropolitan, Chancellor of the University of
<hi>Oxford,</hi> and one of the Lords of his Majesties
most Honourable Privy Council,</p>

               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>To these, with the Readers patience, shall
be added two other Examples, which, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
they are invironed with the Garter of the
Order, merit Observation.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Now because the Kings of Arms do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in like manner (as Bishops use) impale
the Arms peculiar to their several Offices toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with their own Paternal Coats, as <hi>Baron</hi>
and <hi>Femme,</hi> but always in such case marshal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Paternal on the left side, I will insert
one of their impalements, as in Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>To the end it may be the better conceived
what is meant by the right and left sides of an
Escocheon or Coat-Armour born impaled after
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:55096:151"/>
this manner, you may imagine a man to be
standing before you, invested in a Coat depict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Arms of two several Families thus
conjoyned in Pale; and then that part that doth
cover his right side will answer to your left:
So then accounting the Coat to be his that
weareth it, you cannot erre in your judgment
touching the true distinction of the dexter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of the Escocheon, that is due to the Man
as to the more worthy, from the sinister part
that is allotted to the Woman, or the Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
               <p>The manner of such impaling of Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of distinct Families (as <hi>Baron</hi> and
<hi>Femme</hi>) by persons Temporal, is divers from
this before mentioned; for they do evermore
give the preheminence (of the dexter side) to
the man, leaving the sinister to the woman,
as in Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>If these were not Hereditary Coat-Armours,
yet should they have this form of marshalling
and none other, because the same is common
as well to single marriages having no heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Possessions, as to those that be hereditary.
Only in this these have a prerogative, which
the other have not, that the <hi>Baron</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Issue by his <hi>Femme,</hi> it is in his choice
whether he will still bear her Coat in this sort,
or else in an Inescocheon upon his own, because
he pretendeth (God giveth life to such his Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue)
to bear the same Coat of his Wife to him
and to his heirs; for which cause this Escoche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thus born is called an Escocheon of pretence.
Moreover, the heir of these two Inheritors
shall bear these two Hereditary Coats of his
Father and Mother, to himself and his heirs
quarterly; to shew, that the Inheritance, as
well of the Possessions, as of the Coat-Armours,
are invested in them and their Posterity; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
if the wife be no heir, neither her husband
nor child shall have further to do with her
Coat, than to set up the same in their house,
Paleways, after the foresaid manner, so to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the memorial of the Fathers match with
such a Family. Examples whereof behold in
hese following Escocheons.</p>

               <p>This form of bearing of divers Coats mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalled
together in one Escocheon impaled, as
aforesaid, was in use near hand within a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
years since within the Realm of <hi>France,</hi>
as appeareth by <hi>Frances de Rosiers, lib. Stem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum
Lotharingiae;</hi> where amongst many
Transcripts of Kings Charters made to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Houses, under their Seals of Arms, he
mentioneth one made by <hi>Dagobert</hi> King of
<hi>France,</hi> to <hi>Modoaldus</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Trevers,</hi>
for the Cell of St. <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi>
which Charter was sealed with three Seals:
His words are these, <hi>Hoc diploma tribus sigil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
firmatum est, primo aureo Dagoberti,</hi> which
was (as he had formerly described it) <hi>habens
insculptum scutum liliis plenum, secundo cereo
Cuniberti, tertio etiam cereo Clodulphi; in
quo est scutum partitum impressum, prior pars
decorata cruce, ac Escarbocle, seu Carbunculo;

Incarnationis,</hi> 622.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning the orderly bearing of such Coat-Armours
Paleways in one Escocheon, note that</hi>
Gerard Leigh, <hi>making mention of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalling
of divers</hi> Femmes <hi>with one</hi> Baron, <hi>saith,</hi>
If a man do marry two wives, they shall be both
placed on the left side in the same Escocheon
with him, as parted per Pale. The first wives
Coat shall stand on the Chief part, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
on the Base. Or, he may set them both in
Pale with his own, the first wives Coat next
to himself, and his second uttermost. And if
he have three wives, then the two first matches
shall stand on the Chief part, and the third
shall have the whole Base. And if he have a
fourth wife, she must participate the one half
of the Base with the third wife; and so will
they seem to be so many Coats quartered. <hi>But
here you must observe, that those forms of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palings
are meant of Hereditary Coats, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Husband stood in expectancy of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
his Family, through the possibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
Issue, that so those Hereditary Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of his wife might be united to his own
Patrimony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was an ancient way of impaling to take
half the Husbands Coat, and with that to joyn
as much of the Wives, as appeareth in an old
Roll, wherein the three Lions, being the
Arms of <hi>England,</hi> are dimidiated and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with half the Pales of <hi>Arragon.</hi> The
like hath also been practised with quartered
Coats, by leaving out half of them, as in
Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>And for the Antiquity of bearing divers Coats
quartered in one Escocheon, the same Author
<hi>Francis de Rosiers,</hi> reciteth a Charter of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>
King of <hi>Angiers, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,
&amp;c.</hi> concerning his receiving of the Brethren
of the Monastery named <hi>Belprey,</hi> into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
<hi>Actum Nanceij, Anno</hi> 1435. adding in
the end thereof these words, <hi>Arma Arragoniae,
Siciliae, Hierusalem, Andes.</hi> Whereby (if I
mistake him not) he giveth us to understand
that his Seal of Arms did comprehend all these
Coats born together quarterly in one Escoche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
because he holdeth the same form of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of Seals of that kind throughout all
his Collection of Charters.</p>
               <p>As touching this quarterly bearing of many
Coats pertaining to sundry Families together
in one Escocheon, <hi>William Wicley</hi> doth utterly
mislike it, holding the same to be better fitting
a Pedigree to be locked up in a Chest, as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
serving for approbation of the Allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Families, or Inducements to title of
Lands, rather than multitudes of them should
be heaped together in or upon any thing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
for Military use: For Banners, Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards,
and other like Martial Ensigns, were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
for no other use, but for a Commander
to lead or be known by in the Field; to which
purpose these marks should be made apparent
and easie to be discerned, which cannot be
where many Coats are thronged together, and
so become unfit to the Field, and therefore to
be abolished of Commanders.</p>
               <p>Only he holdeth it expedient, that a Prince
or Noble-man, having title to some Countrey,
for the obtaining whereof he is inforced to
make warr, should shew forth his Standard of
the Arms of that Countrey quartered with his
own, amongst those people, which in right
and conscience do owe him obedience; that
they may be thereby induced the sooner
to submit themselves to him as to their true
and lawful Sovereign or Lord. So did <hi>Edward</hi>
the third, King of <hi>England,</hi> when he set on
foot his title to the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth the Arms of <hi>France</hi> quartered in his
Royal Banner with the Arms of <hi>England.</hi> But
for such persons as are but Commanders under
them, it is very absurd, since thereof ensue
oftentimes many dangerous errors; <hi>Et irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuperabilis
est error qui violentiâ Martis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittitur.</hi>
Having before made mention of an
Inescocheon, and of the bearing of the Arms
of the <hi>Femme</hi> by the <hi>Baron</hi> after Issue received
by her, she being an Inheritrix, I will now
here give you an Example, as well to shew the
occasion of such bearing, as also the manner
and situation thereof.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>As for antiquity of bearing of Inescocheons,
I find them very anciently used a long time by
the Emperours of <hi>Germany;</hi> for they always
placed an Inescocheon of their Paternal Coat
on the breast of the Imperial Eagle. And also
divers noble and worthy Families of this Land,
used the like bearing in the several reigns of
sundry of our Kings, <hi>viz.</hi> in the time of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
the second, <hi>Simon Burley</hi> bare in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escocheon
the Arms of <hi>Husly.</hi> In the time of
<hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, <hi>Richard Beauchampe</hi> the great
Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> bare the Arms of <hi>Spenser</hi>
and <hi>Clare</hi> quarterly in an Inescocheon over his
own Paternal Coat-Armour, and many other
in like sort.</p>
               <p>Concerning the bearing of the Wives Coat-Armour
by the Husband impaled, or otherwise,
there are some that do boldly affirm, That it is
not permitted by Law, but only tolerated
through custome; and do (with <hi>Chassanaeus</hi>)
alledge for proof thereof, <hi>Quod Arma non trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eunt
ad cognatos &amp; affines, quia cognati de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendentes
ex femina non sunt de familia:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by reason of her marriage she renounceth
the Name of the Family whereof she is descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and assumeth the Name of her Husbands
Family, as we formerly shewed, where we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
of differences which are not permitted
to the Females. And an especial reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
may be this, <hi>Quia Agnationis dignitas sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
debet esse salva;</hi> the Agnation (which is of
the Fathers side) must be preserved entire, and
therefore the Honour or Arms of it not to be
carried into another Family.</p>
               <p>Now because some misunderstanding the
Rule given in the sixth Chapter of the first Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
where it is said, <hi>That to Daughter never
were any differences allowed,</hi> do hold, that
the Husband in the impaling of his Wives
Coat-Armour with his own, may omit such
difference as her Father (admitting him to be

Brother) bore to distinguish him from the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

unto the young Student in Armory, that
every Gentleman of Coat-Armour which mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
a Gentlewoman whose Father did bear
any difference in his Coat, ought in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palement
of his Wives Arms to retain the same
difference which her Father bore, as in these
Examples.</p>

that is bordured be born sole of it self,
then shall the bordure inviron the Coat round;
but if such a Coat be marshalled Paleways with
another, as a marriage, then must that part of
the bordure which respecteth the Coat annexed,
give place thereunto, whether the Coat
bordured be marshalled on the dexter part of
the Escocheon, or the sinister, as in Example.</p>

Coat-Armour bordured be honoured with a
Canton, quarter, &amp;c. the bordure must in like
manner give place unto them, as in these next

shall no part of the bordure be omitted, but

the bordure shall environ the same round (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

               <p>FRom such marshallings as do betoken mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
I come to such as betoken a gift of
the Sovereign by way of augmentation.
These are bestowed, either for favour or
merit; though the very winning of favour with
Sovereign Princes must be also reputed merit,
because
<q>Principibus placuisse viris non ultima laus est;</q>
To win great Princes love great praise it merits.</p>
               <p>Of the first sort are all those Armorial signs
which the Sovereign (to honour the Bearer, and
to dignifie his Coat-Armour) doth annex to the
Paternal Coat of some especial Favorites, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
unto them some parcel of his Royal
Ensigns or Badges, that so he may transferr to
Posterities some Monument of his gracious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
and of those some are marshalled Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
and others otherways.</p>
               <p>Of the first sort are the next Escocheons,
and their like, wherein the priority of place is
due to those of free gift, which must be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalled
on the dexter side of the Escocheon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Paternal Coat, <hi>Ob reverentiam muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficentiae
Regalis,</hi> as in Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>These may serve sufficiently to exemplifie
the bearing of augmentations or additions
of Honour annexed to Paternal Coat-Armours
Paleways. Now shall follow such as are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalled
with them after some other manner:
for in some of them there is annexed a part in
a part; in other some, the whole in a part. By
a part in a part, I mean the annexing of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of the Royal Ensigns or Badges of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
in or upon some one portion of the
Escocheon, as in or upon a Canton, Chief,
Quarter, &amp;c. as followeth in these next Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>

               <p>Now in the next place, by the Whole in a
part, I mean the bearing of the Royal Ensigns
of the Sovereign wholly in some part of the
Escocheon, as in Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Thus much for tokens of the Sovereigns Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour:
which kind of gifts, though the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
also from high merit (for the most part)
in the receivers, yet we rather entitle them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
than merits, because their gratitude is the

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>IN the precedent Chapter enough hath
been said of augmentations or additions of
Honour bestowed by the Sovereign in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of Princely Favour: Now of such as
he giveth in remuneration of merit, either
immediately by himself, or mediately by his
General or Vicegerent, either in requital of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
service performed, or for encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to future honourable attempts, which is
then chiefly effected when vertue is duly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.
Such remunerations are conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
men imployed either in warfare (be it secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
or spiritual) or in affairs civil.</p>
               <p>Of the first sort were those that were profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the several orders of spiritual Knighthood
of late use in this Land, but now abolished, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Knights of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and
Knights <hi>Templers;</hi> of which the first is the
chiefest, whose beginning, saith Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne,</hi>
was in the time of <hi>Godfrey</hi> first Christian King
of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The profession of this Order was to fight for
Gods honour against the Infidels, and (as they
were taught by the Romish Synagogue) for
holy St. <hi>Iohn.</hi> This Order was begun in the
Year of Grace 1120. Their Habit was a long
Gown or Robe of black, with a white Cross
upon the breast. The Ensign Armorial of their
Order was an Escocheon, Gules, a plain Cross,
Argent. And this is now known for the Arms
of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by reason that the first <hi>Amadeus</hi> or
<hi>Amy,</hi> Earl of <hi>Savoy,</hi> being in Arms with the
Brethren of this spiritual Knighthood at the
siege of <hi>Acres,</hi> after that their Grand-master
was slain by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> least the Infidels
should thereupon take a greater confidence of
Victory by knowledge of his death, at their
request he did put on the Armour of their slain
General, and the long Robe of black Cloth,
with the Arms of the said Order, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaned
himself with such valour in Battel,
that after he had slain the Admiral of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens</hi>
with his own hand, he sunk and put to
flight the most part of their Foists, Ships, and
Gallies, and in fine, redeemed the City of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres</hi>
from a perillous Naval siege.</p>
               <p>For which benefit done to Religion, the
Knights of the said Order requested the said
Earl of <hi>Savoy</hi> to advance for his Coat-Armour
this Ensign here mentioned. Since which time,
all those that entred the said Order, have also
had their Paternal Coat-Armour insigned with
this Cross on the Chief of their Paternal Coat,
as followeth.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>To these donative augmentations of Arms,
I will add certain Arms Assumptive, which are
such as a man of his proper right may assume as
the guerdon of his valorous service, with the
approbation of his Sovereign, and of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald.
As if a man being no Gentleman of blood
or Coat-Armour, or else being a Gentleman of
blood and Coat-Armour, shall captivate or take
prisoner in any lawful warrs any Gentleman,
great Lord or Prince (as saith Sir <hi>Iohn Ferne</hi>)
he may bear the shield of that prisoner, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
it to him and his heirs for ever, if the same be
not by like infortune regained, be he Christian
or Pagan, for that is but a vain and frivolous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction.
These are such as the Bearers or
some of their Ancestors have forced from the
enemy, either in compelling him to flight, and
so to forsake his Arms or Ensigns, or by strong
hand surprise him prisoner, <hi>in justo bello,</hi> or
having slain him, so gained to himself (<hi>jure
gentium</hi>) an absolute interest in the Ensigns
of his conquered Foe. And in this sense may
that assertion of <hi>Bertolus</hi> be verified, where
he saith, <hi>Et jam populares propria authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
arma sibi assumere possunt;</hi> but not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
because the base sort of men having no
generous blood in them, are not capable of
Armorial Ensigns, which are the badges of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
disposition or generous birth, and therefore
they ought not to be bestowed upon such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<hi>Quia entia nolunt malè disponi, Arist.
Met.</hi> But in this sense it may be understood
that he that is not descended of gentle blood,
is holden worthy to bear the Coat-Armour
that he hath gained, for the apparent tokens
of vertue and valour that are found in him.
That the vanquisher may bear the Arms of the
vanquished, I shall make apparent by this next
Example.</p>

               <p>COncerning Coat-Armours marshalled
within the Escocheon, whereof the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
are manifest, we have hitherto
intreated; now of such as have their
occasions less manifest. Those are such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hereditary Coat-Armours are so obscurely
marshalled in one Escocheon, as that thereby
the beholder can yield no reason or yet conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctural
probability of such their union, nor may
well discern them to be distinct Coats: So as
it often falleth out that they are mistaken for
some new coined Coat, rather than two Coats
of distinct Families, and so reckoned to be a
Coat too bad to be born. And such marshalling
is either one above another, or one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Of the first sort may we reckon the
Coat-Armour of <hi>Browne</hi> before exemplified,
as also these following and their like.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>Another form of bearing of divers Coats
(upon like occasion) much different from this,
doth the same Author commend, that is to say,
the bearing of the Mothers Arms upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
(by the heir) in a Bend: And this doth
he reckon to be the best manner of bearing such
Arms, saying, <hi>Optimus certè modus portandi
diversa arma in uno scuto habetur in istis Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,
quia habens patrimonium à suo patre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missum,
&amp; alias certas terras per matrem sibi
provenientes, quibus quidem terris maternis
certa appropriantur Arma ab antiquo, ut fortè
quia ipsa arma materna sortiuntur nomen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniei
suae; Tunc ipse haeres, si voluerit, potest
portare Arma integra sui patris in scuto plano,
&amp; in tali Benda potest portare Arma materna.</hi>
Of this form of bearing you may see a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
in this next Eschocheon.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Not unaptly may these Coats be said to be
obscurely marshalled, when the occasion thereof
cannot be either certainly discerned, or yet
probably conjectured, neither can it be with
reason conceived, whether the Superiour be
born for the Fathers Coat, or for the Mothers.
And thus much shall suffice concerning Coat-Armours
marshalled within the Escocheon.</p>

               <p>AMongst the various bearings of Coat-Armour
in this Book, the Authour, Mr.
<hi>Guillim,</hi> hath given no example of the
bearing of women in a Lozenge, as not
under Covert Baron; which being very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be taken notice of, I have here inserted
the Arms of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e few, who for their Vertues and
generous Educations, may deservedly be made
the Patterns of Bearings in this kind. This
manner of bearing in Lozenges by unmarried
women, may seem to take its rise or original
from the Fusil or Spindle of Yarn, single wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
being called Spinsters, <hi>Nunquam à Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea
transibat ad fusum,</hi> says <hi>Favine,</hi> speaking
of Salique Land, It never past from the Launce
to the Fusil, Lozenge, or Spindle. But <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>
gives a more noble and ancient derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this form of bearing, where he tells us
in the life of <hi>Theseus,</hi> That in the City of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara</hi>
(in his time) the Tombs of Stone where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the bodies of the <hi>Amazons</hi> lay in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were cut in the form or fashion of a Lozenge,
in imitation of their shields, according to the
manner of <hi>Greece.</hi>

Thus much for the bearing of Widows, who
may on no pretence whatsoever bear either
their Paternal-Coat, or their Husbands single;
for if in an Escocheon or Shield, then it will be
taken for the bearing of a man, and if in a
Lozenge, then the bearing proper for a Maiden
Gentlewoman.</p>

               <p>IN the former Chapters hath been treated
of such Coat-Armours as are marshalled
within the Escocheon; in order it now
succeedeth to speak of marshalling with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Escocheon.</p>
               <p>These are certain Ornaments externally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the Coat-Armour of any Gentleman,
by reason of his advancement to some honour
or place of eminency by the gracious favour of
the Sovereign, as an honourable addition to
his generous birth. Of these there are divers
particulars, which being conjoyned and annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a Coat-Armour, do constitute an Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>An Atchievement, according to <hi>Leigh,</hi> is
the Arms of every Gentleman well marshalled
with the Supporters, Helmet, Wreath and
Crests, with Mantles and Words, which of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds
is properly called in Blazon <hi>Heawme</hi> and
<hi>Timbre.</hi> The French word <hi>Heaulme,</hi> which
we call in English an <hi>Helmet,</hi> seemeth to have
given derivation to that word <hi>Heawme.</hi> And
the word <hi>Timmer</hi> to our <hi>Timbre;</hi> for that in the
<hi>Almain</hi> Tongue is the same that we in <hi>Latin</hi>
call <hi>Apex,</hi> or <hi>Summitas acuminata,</hi> and beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth
the Crest that is usually born upon the
Helmet: For so doth <hi>Kiltanus Dufflene</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it, calling it, <hi>Timber of Timber van
Den Helme,</hi> which is as much to say, as <hi>Crista
galeae, Conus galeae, Summus Apex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note, that the general words used by <hi>Leigh,</hi>
in his said description of an Atchievement,
must be restrained only to those particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to whom Supporters (either by Law or by
Custome) are properly due; for that none un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the degree of a Knight Banneret may bear
his Arms supported. And in some Countries
(as by name in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> saith <hi>Chassaneus)</hi> it
is not permitted to persons inferiour to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of a Knight, to Timber their Arms, that
is to say, to adorn them with Helmet, Mantle,
Crest, &amp;c. as <hi>Chassaneus</hi> noteth, saying <hi>Nulli
licitum est, nec solet quis Timbra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e Arma sua,
nisi sit saltem Eques militaris, vulgò Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier.</hi>
But with us the custome is otherwise;
for in bearing of Arms each particular Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
hath something peculiar to it self, and hath
her proper customes which have the vigour of
a Law, <hi>Quia consuetudo, ubi Lex scripta non
est, valet quantum Lex ubi scripta est.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
herein the custome of each Countrey is to
be respected, <hi>Specialis enim consuetudo vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
legem in eo loco ubi est consuetudo, dummodo
post legem fuerit inducta, aliàs vincitur à lege
superveniente.</hi> But it may seem that such
bearing is rather tolerated through custome,
than allowed in the strict construction of the
Law of Arms.</p>
               <p>Now that the things so externally annexed
to Coat-Armour, and also the order of their
placing may the better be conceived, I will
handle each part by it self, wherein I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
that course of Natures Method, which
<hi>Zanchius</hi> saith, was by <hi>Moses</hi> observed in the
History of the Creation, which is, <hi>à principiis
componentibus ad res compositas.</hi> The parts
compounding are those before mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Helmet, Mantle, Crest, &amp;c. of which
some have place above the Escocheon, some
under it, some round about it, some on each side
of it.</p>
               <p>Of the first sort are the Helmet, Mantle, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scroule,
Wreath, Crown, Cap, &amp;c. And foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as with us the Nobles are divided into
<hi>Nobiles majores,</hi> as Dukes, Marquesses, Earls,
Vicounts, Barons and Bannerets; and into <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles
minores,</hi> as Knights, Esquires, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Gentlemen; and that to these particular
degrees there are allotted sundry forms of Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
whereby their several states are discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
I will exemplifie their divers fashions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with the Inferiour sort (for that is the
progress proper to degrees or steps) and so as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
to the highest; as in Example.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>This kind of service is exceeding ancient, as

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:55096:161"/>
them: and therefore the Helmet, born thus
sidelong (if I erre not in my understanding)

               <p>Moreover, there are many more things in
the world, than there are names for them,
according to the saying of the Philosopher;
<hi>Nomina sunt finita, res autem infinitae; ideo
unum nomen plura significat;</hi> which saying is
by a certain (or rather uncertain) Author ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved;
<hi>Multis speciebus non sunt nomina: Id<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circo
necessarium est nomina fingere, si nullum
ante erit nomen impositum.</hi>

Now the bearing of the Helmet in Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is sometimes single, sometimes manifold.
It is said to be born single, when the Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is adorned with one only Helmet, as in
those hereafter ensuing shall be seen.</p>
               <p>I call that a manifold Bearing, when for the
garnishing and setting forth of an Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
two Helmets or more are placed upon
the Shield or Escocheon, because sometimes for
beautifying the Atchievement of some great
personage of noble birth, or eminent place,
three Helmets are placed jointly upon the
Shield.</p>
               <p>Touching the manner of placing divers Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
upon one Shield, these Rules following
are to be observed, <hi>viz.</hi> If you will place two
for the respects aforesaid, then must they be so
set, as the Beaver of the one may be opposite
to the other, as if they were worn by two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
aspecting or beholding each other. But
if you place three Helmets, for any of these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
above remembred, then must you place
the middle standing directly forwards, and the
other two upon the sides, after a sidelong man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
with their Beavers turned toward the
middlemost, in representation of two persons
aspecting the third.</p>
               <p>The next in order of these exterior parts of
an Atchievement, is the Mantle, so named of
the French word <hi>Manteau,</hi> which with us is
taken for a long Robe. This was a Military
Habit used in ancient time of great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in the Field, as well to manifest their high
place, as also (being cast over their Armour)
to repel the extremity of wet, cold, and heat,
and withal to preserve their Armour from rust,
so to continue thereby the glittering lustre
thereof.</p>
               <p>Of this kind of Habit the famous Sir <hi>Geffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Chaucer</hi> maketh mention in the Knights
Tale; where treating of the Adventures of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon</hi>
and <hi>Arcite,</hi> for the love of <hi>Emely</hi> the
Dukes daughter of <hi>Athens,</hi> he describeth the
Habits and Ornaments of the Kings that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
them to the Lists of the Combate:
where of <hi>Demetrius</hi> King of <hi>India</hi> he saith,
that he
<q>
                     <l>Came riding like the god of Arms Mars,</l>
                     <l>His Coat-Armour was of cloth of Thrace,</l>
                     <l>Couch'd with Pearle white round and great,</l>
                     <l>His Saddle was of burnisht Gold newly beat.</l>
                     <l>A Mantle on his shoulders hanging,</l>
                     <l>Beate full of Rubies red as fire sparkling.</l>
                  </q>
Where I collect, that this Mantle here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
was worn for the purposes formerly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and that in the hanging thereof from the
shoulders of <hi>Demetrius</hi> it did cast it self into
many plaits (as naturally all garments of large
size do) which form of plaiting in the Art of
Painting is termed Drapery. <hi>Wolfang. Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
speaking of this kind of Habit, calleth the
same <hi>chlamys mantuelis,</hi> saying, <hi>Chlamys man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuelis
recensetur itidem à Tribellio inter dona
militaria a Galieno Claudio, qui post fuit Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,
data. Zanchius ait, De nostris Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicis
paria tria, singilones Dalmatenses de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem,
Chlamydem Dardaniam Mantuelem unam.</hi>
This sort of Habit have some Authors called
<hi>Toga Militaris,</hi> and other <hi>Lacerna: Ego vero</hi>
(saith <hi>Lazius) togam militarem eandem cum
Lacerna extitisse autumo.</hi> As we shewed a
difference of Helmets used in the garnishing of
Atchievements of persons of different estate and
dignity, so it may seem there hath been in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
time a diverse form of mantling used for
the difference betwixt <hi>Nobiles majores</hi> and <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nores.</hi>
For <hi>Franc. de Rosiers</hi> mentioning the
Charter of <hi>Charles</hi> the second. Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
to the Abby of <hi>Belprey</hi> 1420. he saith
concerning the Seal thereof, <hi>Portat in Tymbre
Aquilam cum paludamento Ducali;</hi> whereby
we may probably gather that Dukes in those
days, and in that place, had a different form of
mantling from persons of inferior degrees: But
in these things, each Nation for the most part
hath some custome peculiar to it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rodolph</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> son of <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
the third, was the first that bare his Arms
Tymbered, as the same Author affirmeth, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Hic Princeps fuit Primus qui portavit
Arma cum Galea Tymbrata, ut patet in literis
ejus &amp; aliorum ducum:</hi> But I suppose the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of these words must be restrained to that
particular place. For <hi>Wolf. Lazius</hi> seemeth
to affirm that such a form of bearing hath been
anciently used amongst the Romans, where he
saith, <hi>Atque hactenus de Cristis quae in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorum
nostrorum insignibus magis ad Romanam
similitudinem accedere arbitror, sic ea cum
pictura nostra in frontispicio operis contule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither hath this habit escaped Transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but hath passed through the forge of pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical
conceit (as well as those Helmets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
handled) insomuch as (besides the bare
name) there remaineth neither shape or sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of a Mantle: For how can it be imagined
that a piece of cloth, or of whatsoever other
stuff, that is jagged and frownced after the
manner of our now common received Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlings
used for the adorning of Atchievements,
being imposed upon the shoulders of a man,
should serve him to any of the purposes for
which Mantles were ordained? So that these
being compared with those, may be more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
termed Flourishings than Mantlings.</p>
               <p>But as they are used in Atchievements, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you call them Mantles or Flourishings, they
are evermore said in Blazon to be doubled, that
is, lined throughout with some one of the Furrs
before handled in the first Section of this Work,
as well of those Furrs that do consist of more
colours than one, as of those that be single and
unmixt. For so the Romans used to wear their
Cloaks or Mantles lined throughout, sometimes
with one coloured Furr, and otherwhiles with
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:55096:162"/>
Furrs of variable colours, whereof they were
called <hi>Depictae penulae:</hi> of which latter sort <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lex.
ab Alex.</hi> speaketh, saying, <hi>Tametsi lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
Caligulam depictas penulas saepe induisse;</hi>
and <hi>Lazius, Penula picta lascivioris vitae im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratoribus
in usu f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>t</hi> whereof he giveth an
instance out of <hi>Tranquillus,</hi> who saith of <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula,</hi>
that he was <hi>saepe depictas gemmatasque
penulas indutus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These were called <hi>depictae penulae,</hi> because of
the variety of the coloured skins wherewith
they were furred or lined, which made a shew
as if those doublings or linings had been paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Some of those doublings are of rare use
at these days, which have been more frequent
in former times, as I find in the Church of
<hi>Gravenest</hi> in the County of <hi>Bedford</hi> in a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
a Mantle, Sable, doubled Varrey.</p>
               <p>Next to the Mantle the Cognizance doth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
the highest place, and is seated upon
the most eminent part of the Helmet; but yet
so, as that it admitteth an interposition of some
Escroll, Wreath, Chapeau, Crown, &amp;c. And
it is called a Cognizance <hi>à cognoscendo,</hi> because
by them such persons as do were them are
manifestly known whose servants they are.
They are also called Crests of the Latin word
<hi>Crista,</hi> which signifieth a Comb or Tuft, such
as many Birds have upon their heads, as the
Peacock, Lapwing, Lark, Heathcock, Feasant,
Rustcock, &amp;c. And as those do occupy the
highest part of the heads of these Fowls; so
do these Cognizances or Crests hold the most
perspicuous place of the Helmet, as by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
following shall appear in their due
place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning the use of these Cognizances or
Crests among the Romans,</hi> Lazius <hi>(having spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of Shields and the garnishing of them with
pourtraitures of living things) hath these
words,</hi> Hactenus de clypeorum pictura, sive
sculptura Romanae Reipub. celebrata, unde
nimirum &amp; nostras caelaturas in his clypeis,
quas Wappas dicunt, profectas credendum est.
Iam enim Galeas illa quoque atque coronas su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra
positas cum cristis atque avium alis repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentabat.</p>
               <p>But that the wearing of such Crests was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to other Nations as well as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
<hi>Alex. ab Alex.</hi> sheweth, affirming that
the Almains and the Cymbrians used Helmets
wrought about with the shapes of hideous ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Animals. The Carians had Rustcocks
for their Crests. <hi>Alexander Magnus</hi> did invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
his Helmet with a gallant Plume of purest
white.</p>
               <p>The Galatians bare sometimes horns, and
otherwhiles the shapes of living things. The
Trojans, Mysians, and Thracians bare upon their
brazen Helmets the ears and horns of an Ox.
<hi>Amongst the rest</hi> (saith he) <hi>that of</hi> Covidius <hi>the
Centurion, which he used in the battel that he
had against the Mysians, was holden to be
admirable; that he bare upon his Helmet a
cup, that one while did flash out flames of fire,
and otherwhiles would suck them in.</hi> Many
more Examples could I give to prove as well
the antiquity as the general use of Crests; but
holding this to be sufficient, I will now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to give Examples of things that are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
between the Mantle and the Crest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with those of inferiour reckoning,
and so to those of better worth and estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <p>THus far have I touched things placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Escocheon; now I will proceed
to such as are placed elsewhere, of which
some are peculiar, some more general.</p>
               <p>By such as are peculiar I mean those that are
appropriate to persons having Sovereign Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
and to such as we called <hi>Nobiles Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jores,</hi>
of which Rank a Baronet is the lowest.
But amongst the particular Ornaments belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Coat-Armours of persons having ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Supreme or Inferiour dignity, there are
some that do environ the Coat-Armour round
about, and do chie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly belong to persons exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Sovereign Jurisdiction, and to such others
as they out of their special favour shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
the same unto, by associating them
into the fellowship of their Orders. Such are
the most honourable Order of the Garter, the
Orders of the Golden Fleece, of Saint <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi>
of the Annunciation; of all which Sir
<hi>William Segar,</hi> late <hi>Garter</hi> King at Arms, hath
written so learnedly, that to his Works I must
again referr the Reader for satisfaction therein;
the discourse thereof being altogether imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to my intended purpose in this present
Work.</p>
               <p>Yet here you must observe, that a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
admitted into the Society and Fraternity of
any two of the Honourable Orders before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
he may in setting forth his Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
adorn the samewith the chief Ornaments
or Collars of both these Orders whereof he is
elected and admitted a Fellow and Companion,
by placing one of the Ornaments next to his
Shield, and the other without the same. In
such manner did the most high and mighty
Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and Earl <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> bear the chief Ornaments
of the Orders of the Garter and of Saint <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But leaving those peculiar Ornaments of
Sovereigns or others, I return to those that are
communicable (by a certain right) as well to
those called <hi>Nobiles majores,</hi> as to Sovereigns.
Such are those which are said to be placed on
the sides of the Atchievements, representing
sometimes things living, and sometimes dead.</p>
               <p>But these of some Blazoners are termed Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters,
whose conceit therein I can hardly
approve, <hi>Quia diversorum diversa est ratio;</hi>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:55096:163"/>
and therefore the Blazon that I would give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
things so different in Nature is, that if things
be living, and seize upon the Shield, then shall
they be called properly Supporters; but if they
are inanimate, and touch not the Escocheon,
then shall such Arms be said to be (not support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but cotised, of such and such things: For
how can those be properly said to support that
touch not the thing said to be supported by
them? Therefore <hi>Nomina sunt aptanda rebus
secundum rationis normam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To persons under the degree of a Knight
Banneret, it is not permitted to bear their
Arms supported, that Honour being peculiar
to those that are called <hi>Nobiles majores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And these Cotises have their name agreeable
to the thing whose quality they represent, and
are so called (as we elsewhere shewed) of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta,</hi>
the Rib, either of man or beast; for it is
proper to the Rib to inclose the Entrails of
things Animal, and to adde form and fashion to
the body; in like manner do these inclose the
Coat-Armour whereunto they are annexed,
and do give a comely grace and ornament to
the same.</p>
               <p>Another ornament there is externally annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Coat-Armour, and that is the Motto or
Word which is the Invention or Conceit of the
Bearer, succinctly and significantly contrived
(for the most part) in three or four words,
which are set in some Scroll or Compartiment,
placed usually at the foot of the Escocheon: and
as it holdeth the lowest place, so is it the last
in blazoning. Of this word <hi>Abra. Franc.</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in this manner, <hi>Quod à recentioribus ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba
quaedom ipsis Armis subjiciantur, videtur
id nuper inventum ad imitationem eorum quae
Symbola à nobis appellantur.</hi> And indeed the
Motto should express something intended in the
Atchievement, though use hath now received
whatsoever fancy of the Deviser; and this
Motto is of universal use to all Gentry and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of what rank soever.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the blazoning of these Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
exteriorly annexed to any Coat-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
it is to be considered, that we are not ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to that strict observation in them, as in the
blazoning of things born within the Escocheon;
for these are the essential parts of Coats, and
those meerly Accidental. For the Crest or
Timber, Wreath, Mantle, Helm, &amp;c. (saith
<hi>Ferne</hi>) are no part of the Coat-Armour, but
Additions to Atchievements added not many
hundred years ago to the Coats of Gentry.
And therefore when you have aptly set forth
all the Fields and Charges, and their Colours
contained within the Escocheon, your Blazon
is done; so that when we shall describe any of
those Exteriour Ornaments, we stand at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for naming of our Colours, and in those it
is held no fault to name one Colour twice.</p>

               <l>That gentle Spirits will quite them with regard.</l>

            <l>BUt He alone, that's free from all defect,</l>
            <l>And only cannot erre (true Wisdom's Sire)</l>
            <l>Can, without error, all in All effect:</l>
            <l>But weak are men in acting their desire.</l>
            <l>This Work is filde, but not without a flaw;</l>
            <l>Yet filde with Pain, Care, Cost, and all in all:</l>
            <l>But (as it were by force of Natures Law)</l>
            <l>It hath some faults, which on the Printers fall.</l>
            <l>No Book so blest, that ever scap'd the Press</l>
            <l>(For ought I ever read, or heard) without;</l>
            <l>Correctors full'st of Art, and Carefulness</l>
            <l>Cannot prevent it; Faults will flee about.</l>
            <l>But here's not many: so, the easier may</l>
            <l>Each gentle Reader rub away their stains:</l>
            <l>Then (when the verbal Blots were done away)</l>
            <l>I hope their profit will exceed their pains.</l>
            <l>Besides, it may be thought a fault in me,</l>
            <l>To have omitted some few differences</l>
            <l>Of Coronets of high'st and low'st degree;</l>
            <l>But this I may not well a fault confess:</l>
            <l>For, 'twixt a Duke and Marquess Coronets</l>
            <l>Is so small odds, as it is scarce discern'd.</l>
            <l>As here i'th' Earl and Vicounts frontilets</l>
            <l>May by judicious Artists now be learn'd,</l>
            <l>Then these are faults that Reason doth excuse,</l>
            <l>And were committed wilfully, because</l>
            <l>Where is no difference there is no abuse</l>
            <l>To Grace, Arms, Nature, Order, or their Laws.</l>
            <l>This breaks no Rule of Order, though there be</l>
            <l>An Order in Degrees concerning This;</l>
            <l>If Order were infring'd, then should I flee</l>
            <l>From my chief purpose, and my Mark should miss.</l>
            <l>ORDER is Natures beauty, and the way</l>
            <l>To Order is by Rules that Art hath found:</l>
            <l>Defect and excess in those Rules bewray,</l>
            <l>Order's defective, Nature's much deform'd.</l>
            <l>But ORDER is the Center of that GOD</l>
            <l>That is unbounded, and All circumscribes;</l>
            <l>Then, if this Work hath any likelyhood</l>
            <l>Of the least good, the good to it ascribes.</l>
            <l>In Truth, Grace, Order, or in any wise</l>
            <l>That tends to Honour, Vertue, Goodness, Grace;</l>
            <l>I have mine ends: and then it shall suffice,</l>
            <l>If with my Work I end my Vital Race:</l>
            <l>And, with the Silk-worm, work me in my Tombe,</l>
            <l>As having done my duty in my Room.</l>
